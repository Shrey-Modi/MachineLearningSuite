Here are the storm\u2019s latest impacts: The tropical storm roared ashore around 6:15 a.m. with 70 mph sustained winds, just shy of hurricane strength. By 2 p.m., maximum sustained winds decreased to near 45 mph, though the tropical-storm force winds extend up to 320 miles from Ophelia\u2019s core, the National Hurricane Center said. It is expected to continue to weaken as it moves farther inland, but power outages could grow as it affects more areas. TRACK THE STORM Ophelia is on track to move across eastern North Carolina and then travel through southeastern Virginia, before heading farther north across the Delmarva Peninsula on Saturday and Sunday, the hurricane center said.  The storm\u2019s shield of rain extends hundreds of miles from its center and is already dumping heavy rain across a large swath of the mid-Atlantic, including Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and New York. Coastal areas in North Carolina are bearing the brunt of impacts as the center of the expansive storm barges into the state. Storm surge flooded coastal areas and inlets in North Carolina overnight and winds gusting to 73 mph hit Cape Lookout, along the state\u2019s Outer Banks. The high winds and rain caused treacherous conditions off the coast of Cape Lookout, prompting the rescue of five people, including three children, from Lookout Bight Friday, officials said. The group had been aboard an anchored sailing vessel \u201cthat was beset by weather conditions\u201d with 35 to 40 mph winds, according to a news release from the US Coast Guard. \u201cThe conditions at the time were 6-foot to 8-foot seas, with occasional 10-foot swells,\u201d the Coast Guard release said. \u201cThe owner of the vessel did not feel comfortable in the channel and requested to be rescued,\u201d the Coast Guard said. No one was injured.  Residents of Washington, North Carolina, were warned to \u201cavoid the downtown area\u201d on Saturday as about 3 to 4 feet of storm surge from Ophelia sent waters over the city\u2019s boardwalk area, a city Facebook post read. About 40 miles south in New Bern, which sits along two rivers in North Carolina about 120 miles east of Raleigh, roads were flooded and water crept inland as the levels rose in the downtown area, city officials said on Facebook.

Ophelia will deliver several key threats through the weekend: Heavy Rainfall: Some places in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia could see between 3 and 5 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts. Other states in the mid-Atlantic could pick up 2 to 4 inches of rain Saturday night through Sunday. Meanwhile, 1 to 3 inches of rain are forecast across southern New York through southern New England beginning Saturday into Monday. Coastal Threats: One to 5 feet of storm surge is possible in some coastal areas, particularly in inlets and rivers from around Surf City, North Carolina, to the Virginia Tidewater. Storm surge flooding could peak Saturday afternoon with another high tide, particularly in the lower Chesapeake Bay. The storm will also bring dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast through the weekend, the hurricane center warned. Strong and Gusty winds: Tropical-storm-force wind gusts \u2013 between 39 and 73 mph \u2013 will affect a wide area of the East Coast throughout the day Saturday.

Team Europe is seeking a record third consecutive Solheim Cup win, needing to reach 14 points on Sunday owing to the fact it\u2019s the current holder.  Dramatic day  Two of the morning\u2019s four foursomes matches \u2013 which sees players of each pair take alternate shots with one ball \u2013 proved to be topsy-turvy affairs. The last contest between the Swedish pair of Linn Grant and Maja Stark and America\u2019s Danielle Kang and Andrea Lee was decided by the final putt on hole 18. Grant needed to make a 12-foot putt on the last to secure Europe\u2019s second point of the session amidst palpable tension \u2013 and the 24-year-old rookie delivered to the obvious delight of the partisan crowd at Finca Cortes\u00edn.  That dramatic putt provided a fitting end to a match which saw momentum swing in favor of Suzann Pettersen\u2019s team, despite Team USA still holding a 7-5 advantage after the morning session.  The afternoon fourballs session \u2013 a format that has each player hitting their own ball and recording the lowest score on each hole for their pair \u2013 immediately saw the leaderboard flooded with European blue after Leona Maguire\u2019s birdie on the second hole, and that impetus remained almost constant in the Spanish sunshine. Maguire and her partner Charley Hull made light work of Nelly Korda and Ally Ewing, finishing after just 15 holes behind a slew of birdies, before making their way back out onto the course to support the rest of the team and bathe in the adulation of the spectators in attendance.  Europe\u2019s brilliance was exemplified by home favorite Carlota Ciganda and Grant\u2019s lightning start to the fourballs, as they made eight straight birdies as a team to seize the initiative in their match against Kang and Lilia Vu. Kang and Vu kept pace admirably, with the former in particular pouring in clutch putts throughout to stay within touching distance \u2013 only to fall short with Ciganda and Grant leveling the scores at 8-8. Sunday\u2019s decisive singles matches \u2013 where all 12 players compete against a member of the opposing side \u2013 could prove a test of endurance for several of the European team who have played in all four sessions so far.

For weeks, Democratic and Republican senators have been watching the House with growing alarm as Speaker Kevin McCarthy has struggled to cobble together the votes to pass a short-term spending bill along party lines \u2013 all as he has resisted calls to cut a deal with Democrats to keep the government open until a longer-term deal can be reached. The initial plan: Let McCarthy get the votes to pass a bill first before the Senate changes it and sends it back to the House for a final round of votes and negotiations. Now with House GOP leaders still struggling to get the votes ahead of the September 30 deadline, Schumer said he would try to cut a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and send it to the House on the eve of a potential shutdown \u2013 all as he signaled he was pushing to include aid to Ukraine as part of the package.  \u201cWe may now have to go first \u2026 given the House,\u201d Schumer told CNN in an interview in his office, moments before he took procedural steps to allow the Senate to take up a continuing resolution, or CR, as soon as next week. \u201cLeader McConnell and I are talking and we have a great deal of agreement on many parts of this. It\u2019s never easy to get a big bill, a CR bill done, but I am very, very optimistic that McConnell and I can find a way and get a large number of votes both Democratic and Republican in the Senate.\u201d If Schumer\u2019s assessment is correct, that would leave McCarthy with a choice: Either ignore the Senate\u2019s bill altogether or continue to try to pass his own bill in the narrowly divided House where he can only afford to lose four GOP members on any party-line vote. But McCarthy could also be jammed by a bipartisan group of members who are openly threatening to sign a petition forcing a vote in the House \u2013 if they get 218 supporters \u2013 and circumvent the speaker altogether. At the moment, McCarthy is scrambling to resurrect his spending plans to try to move 11 year-long funding bills through his chamber \u2013 even though it typically takes months to hash out differences between the two chambers on spending legislation. There\u2019s now talk in House GOP circles about focusing solely on those long-term bills and abandoning a stop-gap resolution altogether, as hardliners threaten to tank it, and as GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has vowed to seek McCarthy\u2019s ouster as speaker if he pushes for such a Band-aid solution. But McCarthy indicated he\u2019s still open to passing a Republican stop-gap bill, and he was non-committal on Friday on how he would handle a plan sent to him by the Senate. It remains to be seen what will ultimately be included in the Senate\u2019s plan. Schumer said in the interview \u201cI hope so\u201d when asked if he expected Ukraine funding to be included as the White House has pushed for $24 billion to aid the country in its war against Russia. \u201cLeader McConnell and I are both strongly for aid for Ukraine, and I believe the majority of the members of both parties in the Senate agree with that,\u201d Schumer said. But pushing such a plan quickly through the Senate will be difficult. Any one senator can slow down action in the Senate \u2013 and Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican \u2013 has vowed to battle a bill that provides money for Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019ll object to sending any more money to Ukraine,\u201d Paul told CNN on Thursday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any more money.\u201d Yet with the GOP divisions over how to proceed, frustration is growing in the ranks. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, a member of Senate GOP leadership, raised concerns about her party\u2019s handling of the spending talks. \u201cI feel like we have control of the House \u2013 I don\u2019t envy my good friend Kevin McCarthy\u2019s position here \u2013 but I think we\u2019re just showing that we don\u2019t have any solutions,\u201d Capito told CNN. \u201cStalemates and government shutdowns are not good solutions.\u201d Asked if she were concerned about the fallout of a shutdown, Capito said: \u201cI do worry about that, the political backlash.\u201d The conversations between the Senate leaders come as House Republicans have no clear path to a solution to extend funding past the critical September 30 deadline. McCarthy said on Saturday he still lacks support from a handful of GOP hardliners to put a Republican stopgap measure on the floor next week. He is expected to hold a call with GOP members Saturday afternoon as they work against the tight timeline \u2013 though many of the hardliners appear to be unshakeable. McCarthy sent House members home for the week on Thursday without any evident plan to avoid the looming shutdown after hardliners in the Republican conference once again scuttled his spending plans and dramatically bucked GOP leadership on a procedural vote over a Pentagon funding bill. Members are expected to return to session on Tuesday. The vote was another blow to McCarthy, who is under mounting pressure and has faced threats of an ouster. This week, McCarthy has been briefing his conference on new plans to keep the government open and attempting to win over wary members on his right flank who revolted over a previous proposal he had hoped to approve this week. Government funding expires at the end of the day on Saturday, September 30, when the clock strikes midnight and it becomes October 1, which marks the start of the new fiscal year. If Congress fails to pass legislation to renew funding by that deadline, then the federal government will shut down at midnight.

There are still a few members that won\u2019t vote for funding the government while we finish all the 12 bills.

Now, his family is suing the governor", "content": "A Black high school student who was suspended over his locs hairstyle and his mother have sued Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and the state\u2019s attorney general for allegedly failing to enforce the state\u2019s CROWN Act, a law that protects against hair discrimination.  Darryl George, a 17-year-old student at Barbers Hill High School in Mont Belvieu, Texas, has been suspended for more than three weeks because officials said his locs \u2013 which he often wears in braids or a ponytail \u2013 violate the Barbers Hill Independent School District\u2019s dress code for male students.    The policy does not prohibit students from wearing locs or braids, but it does place limitations on hair length for male students, stating hair cannot be worn in a style \u201cthat would allow the hair to extend below the top of a t-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes when let down.\u201d   But the federal civil rights lawsuit, filed Saturday in the Texas Southern District Court, argues that Darryl\u2019s suspension is a violation of the state\u2019s CROWN Act, a law that prohibits discrimination against hair texture and protective hairstyles like locs and braids that are \u201ccommonly or historically associated with race.\u201d It also alleges that Abbott and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton have failed to enforce the law, which went into effect on September 1.  The lawsuit notes the plaintiffs are seeking an injunction against Abbott and Paxton to compel them to stop the district from \u201cexposing their students to disciplinary punishment and disciplinary measures due to locs, braid, twists and other protective styles that are alleged to be or that are longer than the District or schools\u2019 length requirement.\u201d   CNN has reached out to Abbott\u2019s and Paxton\u2019s office for comment on the lawsuit, as well as the attorneys for the Barbers Hill Independent School District.   The filing comes days after the district asked a Texas court to clarify if its dress code violates the CROWN Act.  \u201cAlthough we believe the new law does not govern hair length, we are asking the judicial system of Texas to interpret,\u201d Barbers Hill Superintendent Greg Poole said in a statement on Wednesday.    George\u2019s family has previously said they were told Darryl will be sent to a Disciplinary Alternative Education Program, also known as an alternative school, if he refuses to cut his hair. The family told CNN his locs are intertwined with strands from his grandfather and father and that they do not intend to cut them off.   This is not the first time the Barbers Hill Independent School District has faced legal action over the impact its hair policy has on Black students with locs.   In 2020, Sandy Arnold, her son DeAndre and Cindy Bradford sued the school district, claiming the district\u2019s grooming policies amounted to racial discrimination and violated their children\u2019s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, CNN previously reported. Both students wore locs and had been asked to cut them to comply with the district\u2019s policy on hair length.  DeAndre Arnold was also told if he didn\u2019t cut his locs, he would not be able to participate in his graduation ceremony. Instead of cutting his hair, Arnold transferred to another school district.  Later that year, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the district from enforcing its hair-length policy against Bradford\u2019s son. That case is ongoing, according to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which represents the plaintiffs.   In May, Abbott signed the state\u2019s CROWN Act. Arnold told CNN affiliate KTRK at the time that the law\u2019s passage was the \u201cmost validating feeling.\u201d  \u201cAfter all this time to get what we\u2019ve been fighting for, this made everything worth it because I know now they can never do anything like this to anybody else in the state of Texas,\u201d he said.   Two dozen states have enacted versions of a CROWN Act, according to the Economic Policy Institute. California was the first to pass the measure in 2019. Legislation for a national CROWN Act has been unsuccessful.

Poland\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Polish consulates have been accused of participating in a widespread illegal scheme through which migrants from Africa and Asia were issued Polish visas in exchange for large sums of money.  As Poland is a member of the passport-free Schengen area, visas issued by the country grant holders free access to the 27 member states of the Schengen Area, which include 23 EU member states, as well as Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein and also grants entry to some non-Schengen countries. The allegations could further exacerbate European tensions over grain supplies, which have led to Poland saying it will no longer send arms to Ukraine, and Kyiv filing lawsuits against three EU member states, including Poland. Brussels is \u201cfollowing the recent media reporting about these alleged cases of fraud and corruption very closely,\u201d according to the European Commission\u2019s spokesperson Anitta Hipper. \u201cThese allegations are very concerning and give rise to questions regarding the compliance with EU law,\u201d Hipper said in a Wednesday statement. \u201cThis is why Commissioner (Ylva) Johansson wrote a letter to the Polish authorities to ask for clarifications.\u201d Johansson sent a memo posing a \u201cset of detailed questions,\u201d and asked the Polish authorities to reply by October 3, Hipper said.  \u201cSo, we count on the Polish authorities to provide the necessary information to the Commission and to investigate these allegations,\u201d Hipper added.  The Polish Foreign Ministry refuted allegations the ministry \u201chas imported hundreds of thousands of migrants from Muslim countries and Africa.\u201d \u201cIt is not true,\u201d the ministry said in a statement on September 15. Claims that Poland is the EU leader issuing entry permits to the Schengen zone are also not true, the ministry added. But Polish prosecutors announced they had brought charges against seven individuals in a visa-issuing scandal that resulted in the firing of the deputy foreign minister, according to state news agency PAP.  \u201cThe investigation was initiated on March 7 based on information provided by the Central Anticorruption Bureau,\u201d Daniel Lerman, deputy director of the National Prosecutor\u2019s Office Department of Organized Crime and Corruption, said at a news conference on September 14, PAP reported.    \u201cIt concerns paid protection in the acceleration of visa procedures in relation to several hundred visas,\u201d he said, adding that most of the visas were refused. Those visa applications related to foreigners who applied for visas at Polish diplomatic missions in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, India, Singapore and the Philippines, PAP said. The Polish Foreign Ministry said 1,951,000 national and Schengen visas were issued in the last 30 months.

Fidel Jes\u00fas Patino Jaimes, Jair Tom\u00e1s Ramos Dom\u00ednguez and Ezequiel Felix L\u00f3pez were arrested during the operation in Santa Maria and charged with kidnapping, according to a federal criminal complaint. Kidnapping carries a statutory maximum sentence of life in prison, according to a statement from the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California. No shots were fired in the arrests, the source said.  CNN is attempting to locate attorneys for the defendants via court records and the US Attorney\u2019s office and has sought comment from the FBI.  Alleged abduction caught on camera The criminal complaint alleges that last Monday, someone in Highland, California, heard a loud bang outside their home and then reviewed their Ring camera footage. The person saw that two men had taken the victim from his vehicle and pulled him into a silver Jeep Grand Cherokee, the complaint said.  Upon seeing the Ring footage, the investigator noticed front damage to the vehicle that the 17-year-old victim had been driving, according to the complaint. This led the investigator to believe that the alleged kidnappers\u2019 Jeep had caused an accident, which had triggered the teen to exit his vehicle. The teen was then forced into the Jeep. Several hours later, the boy\u2019s mother received a phone call from a Mexican number, and the caller demanded the delivery of $500,000 to an unspecified location in Nogales, Mexico, for his return, the complaint reads. Shortly thereafter, the mother also received a video via WhatsApp, showing her son in the back seat of a vehicle. According to the complaint, the victim appeared to be reading from a script, saying that the abduction was his father\u2019s fault for an incident that took place in Yonkers, New York, and that his father \u201cknew what he stole.\u201d Over the next few days, the victim\u2019s mother continued to receive phone calls from Mexican phone numbers, the complaint detailed. The kidnappers threatened to cut off parts of the teenager\u2019s body if the payment wasn\u2019t made, the complaint said. The ransom was eventually dropped to $100,000 after the victim\u2019s mother said she did not have $500,000. Sophisticated surveillance On Wednesday, FBI agents tracked down a telephone number associated with the suspect\u2019s vehicle, which had been listed for sale on Facebook Marketplace. GPS records for the number, provided to investigators from a telephone company, helped narrow the location of the phone\u2019s user. According to the complaint, the FBI obtained a warrant permitting the use of a sophisticated device called a cell-site simulator, which is a surveillance tool that mimics a cell phone tower, causing phones in the vicinity to register with the simulator. Once phones connect to the device, investigators can pinpoint a particular phone. According to the criminal complaint, the FBI located the phone at a motel in Santa Maria and conducted surveillance from outside the room where the suspect\u2019s device was located. The next morning, authorities executed a search warrant. SWAT team agents from the FBI Los Angeles Field Office entered the motel room Friday through the door and adjacent windows to rescue the teenager and arrest the armed abductors, the law enforcement source said. All three defendants admitted to playing a role in abducting or confining the victim, according to the criminal complaint.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T17:07:23Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922115744-01-menendez-indictment-presser-0922.jpg?c=original", "title": "Does the US prosecute more Republicans or Democrats? Here\u2019s some data", "content": "Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted Friday for the second time in 10 years on bribery and corruption charges. In this new case, federal authorities allege he and his wife accepted a luxury Mercedes, envelopes full of cash and multiple bars of gold in exchange for influence and favors. It\u2019s wild. Read CNN\u2019s report. Menendez denies the allegations, and he has a track record of beating bribery charges. The last time the government took him to court, a jury deadlocked, a judge acquitted him of some charges and the government finally dropped that separate set of bribery charges. Menendez was able to win reelection.  He\u2019s up for reelection again next year, and Democrats badly need to keep his New Jersey seat if they have any hope of maintaining control of the Senate. Evidence against the idea of political bias The case, if nothing else, is a serious complication to former President Donald Trump\u2019s often-repeated claim that he is the subject of a partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d An unusually feisty Attorney General Merrick Garland rejected any such claim during testimony on Capitol Hill this week.   \u201cOur job is not to do what is politically convenient,\u201d he said. \u201cOur job is not to take orders from the president, from Congress or from anyone else about who or what to criminally investigate.\u201d The prosecution, again, of Menendez, which is a major headache for Democrats, could help prove this point. So should the prosecution of Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son, in a gun case that is rarely brought as a standalone charge. But it is worth looking at the recent history of Department of Justice prosecutions of lawmakers. Is one party targeted more than another?  Here\u2019s a look at active and recent federal cases against federal lawmakers and governors. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but it is what I could find going back to 2000 in CNN\u2019s coverage and from other news outlets. Ongoing federal cases against sitting federal lawmakers  There is one against a Republican, Rep. George Santos of New York, and one against a Democrat, Menendez. There is also a non-prosecution to mention. Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, was informed this year by the DOJ that he would not be charged in a long-running sex trafficking probe. Federal cases against recent members of Congress These are federal cases against current or former federal lawmakers. I was able to find nine targeting Republicans and eight targeting Democrats.  Former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, a Republican from Nebraska \u2013 Found guilty in 2022 of three felonies in a case that centered on campaign contributions. Former Rep. TJ Cox, a Democrat from California \u2013 Still awaiting trial after his 2022 indictment, including for fraudulent campaign contributions. Former Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California \u2013 Sentenced to 11 months in prison for misusing campaign funds, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican from New York \u2013 Sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading, but later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. Corrine Brown, a Democrat from Florida \u2013 Served more than two years for setting up a false charity. Former Rep. Steve Stockman, a Republican from Texas \u2013 Sentenced to 10 years in prison for multiple felonies including fraud and money laundering, but pardoned by Trump after serving part of his sentence. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner, a Democrat from New York \u2013 Sentenced to 21 months in prison for sexting with a minor.  Former Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat from Pennsylvania \u2013 Sentenced to 10 years in prison for racketeering, fraud and money laundering. Former Rep. Michael Grimm, a Republican from New York \u2013 Pleaded guilty and sentenced to eight months in prison for tax evasion. Attempted to run again for Congress. Former Rep. Rick Renzi, a Republican from Arizona \u2013 Sentenced to three years for corruption. Pardoned by Trump after he served time. Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey \u2013 Acquitted by a judge and other charges dismissed after a jury deadlocked in a bribery case. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Illinois \u2013 Sentenced to 30 months in prison for misusing campaign funds. Former Sen. Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska \u2013 Conviction by jury for lying on ethics forms was later set aside over allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.   Former Rep. William Jefferson, a Democrat from Louisiana \u2013 Sentenced to 13 years for corruption and soliciting bribes. There was video of him taking $100,000 from an African official. Served multiple years in prison, but many of the charges were later vacated by a judge based on a US Supreme Court decision. Former Rep. Bob Ney, a Republican from Ohio \u2013 Sentenced to 30 months after a guilty plea for corruption tied to disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Former Rep. Randy \u201cDuke\u201d Cunningham, a Republican from California \u2013 Sentenced to eight years in prison after a guilty plea for bribery. Later pardoned by Trump. Former Rep. James Traficant, a Democrat from Ohio \u2013 Sentenced to eight years in prison for corruption after defending himself during trial. Was later expelled from the House. Other prosecutions to consider Two Republican governors and two Democratic governors have been convicted in federal courts in recent decades: Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, was convicted for bribery and corruption. But the US Supreme Court changed the rules in corruption and bribery cases when it threw out the case against McDonnell. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, a Democrat, was convicted for trying to sell his power to appoint a replacement to Barack Obama\u2019s Senate seat. His sentence was later commuted by Trump. Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a Democrat, was convicted by a jury of bribery and corruption and was sentenced to more than six years in prison.  Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican, was convicted on corruption charges after an FBI sting. Did we miss a federal lawmaker convicted or charged? Let me know at zachary.wolf@cnn.com. What\u2019s not included here Local prosecutions \u2013 like the state or local cases against former Rep. Trey Radel, the Republican from Florida, for cocaine possession in Washington, DC, or former Sen. Larry Craig, the Republican from Idaho, for lewd behavior in the Minneapolis airport \u2013 don\u2019t really fit here since they were not conducted by the Department of Justice. Some notable recent DOJ prosecutions have focused on Democrats at the state level, like Andrew Gillum, the Democrat and former Tallahassee, Florida, mayor who ran for governor and lost to Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2018. Gillum was recently acquitted of lying to the FBI.  Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh, also a Democrat, was sentenced to three years in prison after she pleaded guilty to charges related to a scheme in which local nonprofit organizations bought her self-published children\u2019s book. Trump charges Trump likes to argue he\u2019s the subject of a conspiratorial \u201cwitch hunt\u201d engineered by a deep state.  Why, he will often say, was Hillary Clinton not prosecuted for her email server while he is being prosecuted for mishandling classified material? This forgets the history of the 2016 election, which Clinton has said she lost because of then-FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of the investigation of her emails. Comey did not charge her before the election but did criticize her, and then, 11 days before Election Day, he said the investigation had been reopened.

But when you are a star who\u2019s had a blunder, the ramifications can be so much bigger than they are for us civilians. To be fair, most of us don\u2019t have publicists to help us craft our messages, or fans who are there to defend us. Even with those assets, it\u2019s rarely smooth sailing for celebrities who run afoul in the spotlight. Let\u2019s discuss. Something to sip on\u2026 The thing about being in an industry built around performing is that people won\u2019t always believe apologies. When Ashton Kutcher and his wife, fellow actor Mila Kunis, expressed remorse via video after they wrote pre-sentencing character references for their \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d costar Danny Masterson, who was convicted of rape, it did not go over well.  Drew Barrymore faced similar online backlash when she tearfully apologized in a video for trying to resume production on her daytime talk show during the dual Hollywood strikes. Barrymore ultimately deleted the video and pressed paused on new episodes of her show. Comedian and actor Amy Schumer\u2019s humor wasn\u2019t a laughing matter for some when she joked in a social media post about the way Nicole Kidman was sitting at the US Open, and was accused of cyberbulling the star. Schumer explained, \u201cthe joke I was making was the way she was posed didn\u2019t seem like how a human sits. I was not making fun of how she looks. Nicole Kidman is beautiful and one of the most incredible actors of all time.\u201d  You don\u2019t even have to be a star in the traditional sense to have social media turn on you. Jann Wenner is co-founder of Rolling Stone magazine, and after he made controversial comments to the New York Times about women musicians and musicians of color, his subsequent apology fell flat.  Sometimes, the mea culpa reverberates almost as much as what sparked it.  One thing to talk about\u2026 Don\u2019t play with us, *NSYNC. Ever since they recently reunited to present Taylor Swift with an award at the MTV VMAs and announced they have a new single, I can\u2019t stop wishing for a reunion concert tour. I don\u2019t even need a new album (unless they want to) because their old music still holds up. Member Lance Bass told E! that due to the ongoing entertainment strikes, they\u2019re unable to promote their new song \u201cBetter Place\u201d from the upcoming movie \u201cTrolls Band Together.\u201d To me, that means more time to work on putting a tour together. (I\u2019m not letting this go, as you can see.) Joey Fatone said, \u201chopefully, there\u2019ll be a conversation\u201d about getting the band back together.  Consider this a call to action Justin Timberlake, because it feels like if anyone can make it happen, JT can.  You should listen to\u2026 Kylie Minogue is ramping up the \u201cTension.\u201d The queen of making us dance is returning with a new project, her first since the 2020 \u201cDisco\u201d album she blessed us with. \u201cTension\u201d looks to be an equally good time. \u201cThis album is a blend of personal reflection, club abandon and melancholic highs,\u201d Minogue said in a statement. \u201cI felt so much freedom when I recorded it and hope you love it!\u201d Proof that club kids never have to grow up. The new album drops Friday.  Can\u2019t wait to watch\u2026 No matter how many reality relationships fail, we keep falling for it. The Netflix hit \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d in which men and women must decide whether or not to get engaged before seeing each other, returns for its fifth season Friday. Despite knowing exactly how things usually play out, I\u2019m still chips in. The thing about reality dating shows is we tend to romanticize a happily every after, when in reality the vast majority of the relationships will crash and burn. Still, we love love, and the idea that a person could find their soulmate while sitting in a pod having no idea what they look like is an entertaining fantasy to get lost in. At the very least, there\u2019s always the drama of getting to the altar and seeing who actually goes through with a wedding to enjoy.

It\u2019s time for a win-win agreement that keeps American auto manufacturing thriving with well-paid UAW jobs,\u201d Biden said in a post to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Biden\u2019s trip, and the historic presidential appearance on a picket line, underscores the political opportunity as the strike against the nation\u2019s three largest automakers \u2013 General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis \u2013 enters its second week. It will come one day before former President Donald Trump, currently the front-runner in the GOP presidential race, is scheduled to deliver a prime-time speech to an audience of current and former union members, including from UAW, in Detroit. Earlier in the week, Trump\u2019s team confirmed he would be skipping the second Republican primary debate for the Michigan speech. The former president on Saturday lambasted Biden\u2019s plans, claiming Biden is only going to Michigan because Trump had announced his own trip. \u201cCrooked Joe Biden had no intention of going to visit the United Autoworkers, until I announced that I would be heading to Michigan to be with them,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cIf the UAW \u2018leadership\u2019 doesn\u2019t ENDORSE me, and if I don\u2019t win the Election, the Autoworkers are \u2018toast,\u2019 with our great truckers to follow.\u201d While Biden has repeatedly touted his status as the most pro-labor president, the UAW has yet to offer an endorsement of his reelection bid as he faces low polling numbers on his handling of economic issues.   Union members, once a reliable Democratic voting block, have gradually gravitated to Republican candidates, according to CNN polls and the AFL-CIO. However, UAW President Shawn Fain publicly denounced Trump\u2019s trip earlier this week. Biden\u2019s Tuesday trip was first reported by The Washington Post. Earlier in the day, Fain invited Biden to join the picket lines after announcing an escalation of the union\u2019s strike. \u201cWe invite and encourage everyone who supports our cause to join us on the picket line from our friends and family families, all the way up to the president of the United States,\u201d Fain said Friday at a press conference. \u201cWe invite you to join us in our fight. The way you can help is to build our movement and show the companies that the public stands with us.\u201d  A historic visit amid political pressure Biden visiting a picket line is likely a first for any president. Jeremi Suri, a presidential historian and professor at University of Texas at Austin, said he doesn\u2019t believe any president has ever visited a picket line during a strike. Presidents, including Biden, have previously declined to wade into union disputes to avoid the perception of taking sides on issues where the negotiating parties are often engaged in litigation. The National Labor Relations Board, whose members are appointed by the president but expected to function as an independent entity, currently has nearly 30 cases pending that were filed by the United Auto Workers.  Earlier this year Fain was vocal in his criticism of Biden, especially for his administration\u2019s financial support of a transition by the auto industry from traditional gasoline powered cars to electric vehicles, which the UAW sees as a threat to its members\u2019 jobs. In June, when the administration approved a $9.2 billion government loan so that Ford and South Korean battery manufacturing partner SK could build three EV battery plants, Fain attacked Biden directly. \u201cWhy is Joe Biden\u2019s administration facilitating this corporate greed with taxpayer money?\u201d Fain said at that time. After Fain and Biden met face-to-face at the White House in July, the union boss has been far less critical of the president in public comments. And Biden has echoed many of the union\u2019s talking points during its ongoing negotiations with the automakers. On September 15, the day the strike started, Biden said that the automakers \u201cshould go further to ensure record corporate profits mean record contracts for the UAW.\u201d Some Democratic politicians have been urging Biden to do more. California Rep. Ro Khanna on Monday told CNN\u2019s Vanessa Yurkevich that Biden and other Democrats should join him on the picket line.   \u201cI\u2019d love to see the president out here,\u201d he said, arguing the Democratic Party needs to demonstrate it\u2019s \u201cthe party of the working class.\u201d  This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting.

By Friday, however, the number of migrants crossing the Rio Grande into the United States near Eagle Pass had dropped by more than two-thirds compared to two days earlier, according to Salinas.   Between 800 and 1,000 migrants were apprehended Friday, Salinas said.  An estimated 3,000 migrants crossed near Eagle Pass on Wednesday, according to Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber. Salinas said he believed one reason for the drop was the shutdown of train lines running to northern Mexico. He said migrants were possibly waiting for train service to restart. CNN also observed a heavier presence of law enforcement barriers and military personnel along the Mexican side of the Rio Grande in the city of Piedras Negras.  Authorities have identified disinformation from smugglers, poor economies, authoritarian regimes and the climate crisis as forces driving migration. Many who leave their homes for the US face long and dangerous treks in hopes of finding better, safer lives. Some flee violence, while others migrate for economic opportunities or to reunite with family, according to experts. Deteriorating conditions in Latin America exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic also have contributed to the migrant surge. The latest wave of migrants at the border has put immense pressure on federal resources and tested President Joe Biden\u2019s border policies.

She says he was a victim, too.", "content": "\u201cNow the family tree goes like this,\u201d the man on the tape extolled confidently. \u201cJohn John and\u2026Trump are cousins. And Trump\u2019s uncle is JFK Sr., and Joe Kennedy, who is also not dead\u2026. And Trump\u2019s father is General George Patton, and his brother is Mussolini\u2026\u201d  Colleen Protzman listened on, despondent. The man talking on the tape was her son, Michael Protzman.   \u201cAnd the thing is,\u201d she said, \u201che believes that.\u201d  Her son had become the leading figure in a QAnon off-shoot that believed John F. Kennedy Jr., who died in a plane crash off Martha\u2019s Vineyard in 1999, was alive and secretly working with former President Donald Trump to save the United States from an evil cabal.  It\u2019s the kind of conspiracy theory that one might assume manifests only in the dark corners of the internet.   But that changed on November 2, 2021, when hundreds of people from around the country gathered at the infamous grassy knoll in Dallas\u2019 Dealey Plaza, where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. The congregation wasn\u2019t there to commemorate the death of the 35th President of the United States. They were there to see what they desperately hoped would be the return of the Kennedys.   \u201cWord on the street is Junior \u2014 JFK Jr \u2014will show up and introduce his parents,\u201d one believer told the local WFAA news crew who had rushed to the plaza after hearing reports of a large crowd gathered. Asked what he expected would happen, the man earnestly replied: \u201cHe\u2019ll (JFK Jr.) probably be the vice president with Trump.\u201d  The late JFK and his son failed to materialize. Most of the gathered crowd went home and moved on with their lives, some of them disappointed the impossible hadn\u2019t occurred. But others stayed, waiting for months in Dallas for the Kennedys to return.  Somehow, the Kennedys, a family dynasty that once embodied the Democratic Party, had become heroes in a movement that also worshipped Trump. A bizarre blend of American lore, dating back to JFK\u2019s assassination, along with biblical and QAnon-adjacent prophecies, suggested the Kennedys and Trump were direct descendants of Jesus Christ and were the heroic protagonists in an age-old battle of good versus evil.   The tale is objectively wacky, yet it managed to strike a chord. Hundreds of people showed up that day in Dallas hoping for at least one Kennedy to reemerge. Others left their lives, families and jobs behind entirely for months waiting on that false promise. But why?  To dismissively reduce the answer to this question as a collective delusion of \u201cQAnon crazies\u201d is to ignore the profound impact fringe conspiracy theories are having on American families and American democracy.   These false beliefs are a symbol and symptom of a broader ideology that thrives on anger, disillusionment and loneliness and is fueled by politically and financially motivated opportunists who have weaponized the community-building capabilities of social media.    Michael Protzman got swept up in this alternate reality.  Depending on who you ask, Protzman was either a victim whose convictions and worldview were so radically altered by what he was reading on the internet that it cost him his family, his home and his business. Or he was a manipulative opportunist who conned his followers into believing a warped QAnon-style biblical prophecy that tore them away from their families \u2013 some of whom believe he spawned a cult.   To better understand how online misinformation is affecting American families, CNN spent the past year tracking Protzman and his followers for a documentary that will air on CNN as part of The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper series.   We spoke to dozens of Americans whose lives and families have been affected by conspiracy theories, including Protzman\u2019s own family.  In June, Protzman was severely injured in an accident on a motocross track in Minnesota and died a few days later. He was 60 years old.  But the tragic tale of Michael Brian Protzman began long before the accident.  Prey  Michael \u201cwasn\u2019t a computer person,\u201d his mother, Colleen Protzman, said. But in the years after the 2008 financial collapse, he began researching online about investing in silver. Many websites that tout the sale of precious metals like silver rely on doomsday conspiracy theories of a global monetary collapse to convince people to hand over their cash.  At the time, Michael was living with his wife and two children near Seattle. He ran a demolition business but was worried about his family\u2019s financial future. \u201cHe knew that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to keep doing this work forever because it\u2019s really hard on your body,\u201d his mother told CNN.  It was with those worries, and some other personal family problems, that the conspiracy theory sites began to suck him in.  Over time, his fear became palpable \u2013 the US dollar was about to collapse. He wanted his mom to cash in her 401(k) retirement savings and invest it into silver, she said.   \u201cHe just was so adamant about the fact that he was afraid that we, his family, his sisters and me and his wife and his daughter was going to be left without if we didn\u2019t all understand that this was going to happen and that we didn\u2019t invest,\u201d she explained.    After a few years, Michael\u2019s worldview had extended to conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre.  \u201cI think he became more isolated,\u201d his mother said. \u201cAnd the more isolated he became, the more he needed his family to agree with him, to believe everything that he believed. And we didn\u2019t.\u201d  Colleen Protzman agreed to speak to CNN in February this year because she wanted people to know who her son was before he had become an accused cult leader \u2014 in her eyes, the real Michael.   She spoke of a loving son, a hard-working dad, someone who was committed to looking after his family. She recounted one occasion when Michael was driving on Interstate 5 near their home in Washington state and spotted a family whose car had broken down in the pouring rain. Michael pulled over, helped the family get to a garage and new dry clothes. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of person he was,\u201d his mother said.   But, she said, as the years went on and Michael fell further down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, he began engaging with QAnon  \u2013 the sprawling online delusion that claims former President Donald Trump is a hero set to save the US from an evil cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles.   It was quite the transformation \u2013 Michael had voted for President Barack Obama twice, according to his mother, and had been a fan of liberal icon Rachel Maddow. He \u201cthought she was fantastic, smart, right on,\u201d she recalled.   Eventually, conspiracy theories became all that Michael could talk about. His mother tried to help him debunk some of the misinformation he was sending her, but to no avail. Over time, he grew frustrated that his family refused to believe the same false claims he was espousing. His family grew frustrated, too, exhausted by his proselytizing.    By November 2021, as Michael and his followers made headlines across the country with their bizarre gathering in Dealey Plaza waiting for the Kennedys to inexplicably appear, he was no longer living with his family, his wife was preparing to file for divorce and his business had shut down.   The fascination with the Kennedys emanates from a QAnon mythology off-shoot. The anonymous online account with a long history of false predictions and nonsensical posts at the center of the QAnon phenomena, dubbed \u201cQ,\u201d suddenly went silent for a period in 2018, giving way to another anonymous account that introduced the Kennedy narrative.   The conspiracy theory suggests, without evidence, that JFK Jr. didn\u2019t really die in a 1999 plane crash and that he is working with Trump to save America. Believers claim JFK Jr. will become vice president in the next Trump administration, with some going as far as to suggest JFK himself may walk among us again because he is Jesus Christ.   Indeed, some QAnon followers think this is wacky, and the original \u201cQ\u201d account, once it started posting again in 2018, disavowed the conspiracy theory. But still, the belief among some lives on.  Predator  \u201cHe took my person,\u201d Erica Vigrass said, holding back tears.  Her brother Jason went to Dallas in November 2021 to witness what he believed would be JFK\u2019s return and remained there. He spent months in Dallas and traveling around the country with Protzman and his followers to Trump rallies.   Jason, Erica believes, found Michael Protzman on Telegram, a social media messaging app that surged in popularity in the US after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol when major platforms like Facebook and Twitter shut down the accounts of prominent conspiracy theorists.   It was there Protzman found an audience, people who validated his beliefs in the conspiracy theories his family had been telling him for years were absurd. \u201cI remember him telling his friend \u2018I\u2019m on Telegram, and all of a sudden I have these followers,\u2019\u201d Protzman\u2019s mother recalled.  Protzman often delivered live sermons to his followers for hours at a time on Telegram. The long, meandering monologues included a dizzying use of gematria, the practice of assigning a numerical value to each letter of the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3\u2026 etc.). Protzman used gematria to try to prove connections between the likes of the Kennedys and Trump.   The nonsensical claims have nevertheless proven effective at drawing people in \u2013 Protzman had tens of thousands of followers on Telegram \u2013 including Erica Vigrass\u2019 brother Jason.  Vigrass and other families whose loved ones left home to follow Protzman believed him to be a master manipulator who cut people off from their families and overwhelmed them with wacky theories and gematria.   Erica said her youngest daughter once told Jason she had a fear of being kidnapped. After that, Erica said, Jason began reading online about instances of child abduction, trafficking and abuse in the US.   These are very real issues. But online, the reports of crimes and the claims around them have been weaponized, with bad actors spreading disinformation designed to exploit one of our most basic instincts \u2013 to protect children. Democratic Party politicians and Hollywood celebrities have been labeled pedophiles and falsely claimed to be part of a cabal who abuse and traffic children.   It is a deeply unoriginal conspiracy theory that dates to the Middle Ages, when Jews were accused of using the blood of Christian children in rituals. But it has sustained through the centuries \u2013 perhaps because of the instinctive emotions it stirs among believers.  \u201cI think that one of the main things that caught Michael\u2019s attention was that there was such a concerted effort to harm children,\u201d Protzman\u2019s mother said. \u201cThere\u2019s this group, not only in our country, but in the world that controls everything. And their main thing is that they harm children in all kinds of awful ways. And that just set him off.\u201d  \u201cThese people are lost,\u201d she continued, \u201cjust like [Michael] became lost.\u201d   Protzman \u2013 just like Jason \u2013 was a victim in all this too, she believes. He fell down the rabbit hole the same way his followers had, he just went a lot further down it.  \u201cThey weren\u2019t forced to go to Dallas. They\u2019re not forced to be there, but they have been sucked in just like [Michael] has been sucked in,\u201d Protzman\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t start out to have a cult,\u201d she said, though she acknowledged that her son had become complicit in the problem.   After Michael Protzman died this summer, some of his followers refused to believe he had passed. Like JFK Jr., some of them said, Protzman had faked his own death. Indeed, some believed it was possible Michael was JFK Jr.   Colleen Protzman hoped her son\u2019s death might be an opportunity for his former followers to reflect and return to their families. \u201cMaybe they can put this behind them,\u201d she said, \u201cand realize that whatever they were following or looking for, at least as this part is, is done.\u201d  Beyond JFK  The cases of Michael Protzman and Erica Vigrass\u2019 brother may sound extreme \u2013 and in many ways they are \u2014 but they are also illustrative of a wider problem gripping potentially millions of American families. Vigrass never imagined that the conspiracy theories her brother was airing at the kitchen table could lead to him to join what she views as a cult.   \u201cTake it seriously and know that it\u2019s far more insidious than it might seem,\u201d Vigrass warned. \u201cIf they\u2019re speaking to you about it, the amount it has consumed them is quite possibly far greater than you can imagine.\u201d  Families are often the only ones who see the devastating harm wrought by conspiracy theories when a loved one becomes consumed by false information.  \u201cSo much of the pain and trauma and destruction that QAnon is inflicting goes on behind closed doors, behind the scenes,\u201d said Jesselyn Cook, a journalist and author who has spent years talking to families contending with misinformation. \u201cIt\u2019s not playing out in the news. It\u2019s not playing out in the public eye. It\u2019s happening at the dinner table. It\u2019s happening over the phone with your grandmother.\u201d  These dangerous, alternate realities have torn families and the fabric of society apart and manifested in a deadly attack on the US Capitol. The further one goes down the rabbit hole the more likely they are to encounter, and perhaps accept, racist and anti-Semitic hate, researchers say.  Diane Benscoter, a former member of the Unification Church (better known as the \u201cMoonies\u201d) who now runs Antidote, a nonprofit that helps people who have fallen victim to disinformation and cults, told CNN she has seen an explosion in people looking for help.  While there are an endless number of reasons why people have found themselves sucked into these alternate realities, all the families and experts CNN spoke with said a sense of belonging and community played a key role.  Bowling Alone, a seminal study published in 2000, documented the decline of social capital in the United States over the latter half of the twentieth century \u2013 in part by observing the decline in membership of bowling and other social clubs.  The social media networks that have emerged since have driven many of us apart. Earlier this year, the US Surgeon General said loneliness and isolation had reached epidemic levels.  It\u2019s led Benscoter, a self-described former cult member, to believe that the proliferation of conspiracy theories in 21st century America should be treated as not just a political problem, or a mental health problem, but a public health problem.  The threat, she said, goes far beyond the splintering of American families, with the attack on the US Capitol demonstrating the dangerous potency of these lies.   \u201cI think we\u2019re at a real, real crisis situation,\u201d Benscoter said. \u201cI think that we could lose democracy.\u201d ", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T14:07:58Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230130140914-02-andrei-medvedev.jpg?c=original", "title": "Ex-Wagner commander arrested in Norway for attempting return to Russia", "content": "Norwegian police have arrested a former commander of the Wagner mercenary group on suspicion that he tried to illegally cross the border back into Russia after seeking asylum in Norway earlier this year, the man\u2019s lawyer said on Saturday.

An officer with the Finnmark local police declined to give the arrested man\u2019s identity. Crossing the border to Russia is only allowed at designated points. But Medvedev\u2019s arrest was due to a misunderstanding, his Norwegian lawyer Brynjulf Risnes told Reuters. \u201cHe was up there to see if he could find the place where he crossed (into Norway in January). He was stopped when he was in a taxi. He was never near the border \u2026 It was never his intention to cross the border (into Russia),\u201d Risnes said.  At the time of his arrival in Norway, Medvedev said he was seeking asylum because he feared for his life after witnessing the killing and mistreatment of Russian prisoners brought to the frontline in Ukraine. His escape in January made headlines around the world as a rare example at the time of someone defecting to a Western country while claiming to have fought for Russia as a mercenary in the Ukraine war.

Speaking to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins in an interview on Friday, Netanyahu touted the potential pact as \u201ca quantum leap\u201d in the region.  But he refused repeatedly to say what kind of concessions he would offer Palestinians in order to get the deal across the line. It would \u201cchange the Middle East forever,\u201d he said \u2013 bringing down \u201cwalls of enmity\u201d and creating \u201ca corridor of energy pipelines, rail lines, fiber optic cables, between Asia through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates.\u201d The White House has been in talks with Riyadh for several months over the purported agreement to normalize relations between the two countries. Saudi Arabia, like many Arab states, does not currently recognize Israel; such a deal would have potential to enhance Israel\u2019s acceptance in the Muslim world, particularly considering Saudi Arabia\u2019s role as the custodian of Islam\u2019s holiest sites.  In 2002, Saudi Arabia proposed an \u201cArab Peace initiative\u201d which offered Israel security and \u201cnormal relations\u201d with 57 Arab and Muslim countries in exchange for its withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territories and the creation of an independent Palestinian state. But Israel rejected the initiative at the time. This week, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said that a normalization pact with Israel would be \u201cthe biggest historical deal since the Cold War.\u201d   In an interview with Fox News, bin Salman added that he hopes the deal will \u201creach a place that will ease the life of the Palestinians\u201d \u2013 but stopped short of calling for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, which has been Riyadh\u2019s official stance for two decades.  Netanyahu has made tightening relations with Saudi Arabia a linchpin of his premiership, although it is unclear what kind of concessions toward Palestinians would be allowed by his right-wing coalition.  In his interview with Collins, Netanyahu declined to say what kind of concessions he might make to Palestinians for the nromalization deal, but emphasized that he believes making peace with the broader Arab world would be a step toward resolving Palestinian-Israeli conflict \u2013 what he called an \u201coutside-in\u201d approach.  He also repeated a point made in his UN address earlier that day, saying that he believed Palestinians should \u201cbecome part of the process\u201d \u2013 but not wield the ability to veto it.  Speaking to the UN General Assembly in New York this week, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas warned against trying to sideline his people\u2019s demands in any possible normalization agreement.   \u201cThose who think that peace can prevail in the Middle East without the Palestinian people enjoying their full legitimate national rights would be mistaken,\u201d Abbas said at the UNGA.   Tensions in the region have skyrocketed in recent weeks, amid increased Israeli military raids on Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank. Israel says the raids are intended to prevent or punish Palestinian militant attacks on Israeli civilians because the Palestinian Authority is failing in its security obligations.  The number of Palestinians and Israelis killed this year is on track to be the highest since the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, two decades ago.  Despite apparent momentum toward a normalization deal, Netanyahu\u2019s relationship with US President Joe Biden has soured in recent months, as officials in Washington raise concerns over his efforts to scale back the powers of Israel\u2019s Supreme Court.  The judicial overhaul has triggered the longest and largest protest movement in Israeli history, dividing the Knesset over a crucial proposal that critics say would threaten the country\u2019s democracy.  Part of the overhaul is a law that would restrict the court\u2019s ability to strike down government actions it deems \u201cunreasonable.\u201d Israel\u2019s Supreme Court held hearings on the law to curb its powers earlier this month.  The US president had previously warned against the proposals, suggesting it is an erosion of democracy and could undercut US-Israel relations.  Asked by Collins about the damage the judicial overhaul poses to US-Israel relations, Netanyahu responded, \u201cI think the damage is not the reform, it\u2019s the way the reform is misrepresented, as some kind of collapse of democracy.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T23:11:52Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230923083059-nebraska-teen-abortion-mother-sentenced-0922.jpg?c=original", "title": "A Nebraska mother who provided an illegal abortion for her daughter and helped dispose of the fetus gets 2 years in prison, report says", "content": "A Nebraska mother who was accused of helping her 17-year-old daughter have an illegal abortion and disposing of the fetus was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday, the Norfolk Daily News reported.

CNN has reached out to Burgess\u2019s attorney, the Madison County attorney and the Madison County District Court for comment.  Burgess\u2019s daughter, Celeste Burgess, now 19, was sentenced in July to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to a felony charge of removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body.  Norfolk police began investigating the women in April 2022 following concerns Celeste Burgess had delivered a stillborn fetus, according to court documents.  Authorities alleged Celeste Burgess had a medication abortion, and that it violated the state\u2019s prohibition of abortion after 20 weeks. Celeste Burgess was around 28 weeks pregnant when her pregnancy ended, court documents alleged. Earlier this year, Nebraska\u2019s governor signed a bill into law that bans most abortions after 12 weeks, with exceptions for sexual assault, incest and medical emergencies. Investigators used Facebook messages between the Burgesses to establish that they discussed obtaining abortion pills and burning \u201cthe evidence,\u201d court documents showed. The pills purchased by Jessica Burgess are not prescribed by doctors after a pregnancy has reached 10 weeks, Madison County Attorney Joe Smith said, according to the Norfolk Daily News.  \u201cThis defendant actually gave these drugs to her own daughter,\u201d Smith said, according to the newspaper. \u201cThe defense lawyer did a good job avoiding a child abuse case.

The slide affected around ten vehicles, a wooded area, a business area with a gas station and a fast food restaurant, the rescue services said. \u201cA number of people have been helped out of vehicles in the slide area with the help of fire personnel and a helicopter.\u201d Several cars and one truck had fallen into holes and cracks caused by the landslide, Swedish news agency TT reported. A rescue services spokesperson told public broadcaster SVT all people in the vehicles had been helped out. Police said on their website they had launched a probe into whether work at a nearby construction site may have caused the slide. \u201cIt\u2019s still unclear if there is any connection to blasting/work at the site and the landslide,\u201d they said. \u201cNo person is currently suspected of a crime.\u201d The rescue services said specially trained staff and search dogs would now search the area, and that further slides could not be ruled out.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T13:00:36Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921030155-01-family-google-maps-accident.jpg?c=original", "title": "Family sues Google alleging its Maps app led father to drive off collapsed bridge to his death, attorneys say", "content": "Google has been sued by the family of a North Carolina man claiming the company\u2019s Maps application last year led him to drive off a collapsed bridge and fall about 20 feet to his death, according to the lawsuit.  Philip Paxson was following Google Maps directions while driving home late at night in September 2022 from his daughter\u2019s 9th birthday party when the navigation system directed him to go over an unmarked and unbarricaded bridge that had collapsed years prior, the suit filed Tuesday states. Paxson drove off the unbarricaded edge of the bridge in Hickory, North Carolina, and drowned, the suit says.  The lawsuit claims neighbors had expressed concern Google Maps had led drivers over the bridge, which allegedly has not been repaired since its partial collapse in 2013.  \u201cFor years before this tragedy, Hickory residents asked for the road to be fixed or properly barricaded before someone was hurt or killed. Their demands went unanswered,\u201d Paxson family attorney Robert Zimmerman said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve discovered that Google Maps misdirected motorists like Mr. Paxson onto this collapsed road for years, despite receiving complaints from the public demanding that Google fix its map and directions to mark the road as CLOSED.\u201d Though residents notified Google Maps of the hazardous bridge, the application continued to navigate drivers over it, claims the suit, which includes a report made to Google Maps by a woman asking it to update its navigation system; CNN is unable to verify the veracity of the exhibit. \u201cYou are not able to cross this road. GPS sends people down here, which is especially dangerous for emergency vehicles,\u201d reads the report sent to Google Maps. \u201cPlease update this map so GPS is accurate.\u201d The woman appears to have gotten an email autoreply from Google Maps thanking her for the report, the court filing shows: \u201cYour suggestion is being reviewed. Thanks for sharing your knowledge. We\u2019ll let you know once the changes are published,\u201d it states.  Besides Google, the family is suing its parent company, Alphabet, and two local companies it claims were responsible for maintaining the land and bridge, along with proper barricades and warning signs, and failed to repair the bridge or put up barricades and hazard warnings. The suit claims negligence and willful and wanton conduct by the companies and seeks an unspecified amount in punitive damages.    Google has \u201cthe deepest sympathies for the Paxson family,\u201d it told CNN in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to provide accurate routing information in maps, and we are reviewing this lawsuit.\u201d CNN has sought comment from codefendants Tarde, LLC and Hinckley Gauvain, LLC. Paxson is survived by his wife, Alicia, and the couple\u2019s two daughters, ages 9 and 7, the suit says.  Alicia Paxson told CNN Saturday that police officers came to her door after her husband\u2019s death.  \u201cJust the look on their faces, you know, I just knew,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was the worst day in my life.\u201d  She told her daughters, \u201cDaddy had an accident and he went to heaven.\u201d Her eldest daughter, she said, became angry. \u201c\u2018I want daddy,\u2019 she said. \u2018What are we going to do on Father\u2019s Day? I don\u2019t want to get married. He\u2019s not going to be there,\u2019\u201d Alicia Paxson recalled.  In an earlier statement shared by her lawyers, Alicia Paxson said her family wants to \u201cmake sure our voices are heard.\u201d \u201cMy daughters spent their first Father\u2019s Day without their Dad. They should have been celebrating and spending time with Philip, who devoted his life to his family. Instead, they had to look across the dinner table and see an empty chair,\u201d the wife said.  \u201cOur girls ask how and why their daddy died, and I\u2019m at a loss for words they can understand because, as an adult, I still can\u2019t understand how those responsible for the GPS directions, and the bridge, could have acted with so little regard for human life,\u201d Paxson said.  \u201cNo one should ever lose a loved one this way.\u201d \u201cLike so many motorists, Philip put his trust in Google Maps to safely guide him home from the children\u2019s birthday party,\u201d family attorney Larry Bendesky said in a statement. \u201cHis trust in Google Maps, and the failure of the road and bridge-keepers to do their jobs, cost him his life.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T13:06:49Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230923075711-gun-magazine-california-file.jpg?c=original", "title": "Federal judge overturns California ban on high-capacity gun magazines", "content": "A federal judge struck down California\u2019s ban on firearm magazines holding more than 10 rounds Friday as  unconstitutional, \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The ban, which was adopted through a 2016 proposition, had gone through various appeals until the US Supreme Court sent the case back to lower courts following its 2022 ruling in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association vs. Bruen.

In Bakersfield, California, the legislative chaos in the House of Representatives pushing the country to the brink of a government shutdown \u2013 starring the town\u2019s favorite son, Speaker McCarthy \u2013 hardly registers in this agricultural and oil producing region.  In this Republican district in a solidly Democratic state, belief in McCarthy\u2019s ability to steer his caucus to a resolution remains steadfast, because the born-and-bred Bakersfield native carries the ideals of his city, said longtime ally Cathy Abernathy.  \u201cWe deal in real life\u2019s realities here,\u201d said Abernathy from her Bakersfield office to CNN. \u201cYou have to water that crop and pick it on time, no matter what\u2019s going on. You have to make it work. There isn\u2019t a choice. People in the Central Valley understand deadlines and the forces that fight it while we make it work. And Kevin is one of us.\u201d That confidence contrasts to the alarm blaring miles away in the nation\u2019s capital.  McCarthy\u2019s speakership now hangs in the balance with the clock ticking towards a potential government shutdown and calls from the most conservative members of the House Republican caucus threatening to oust him from the role he struggled mightily to obtain earlier this year. McCarthy has clashed with far-right members who oppose increased domestic spending and additional aid for Ukraine and have blocked multiple efforts by McCarthy to avoid a shutdown. Some of those far-right members are willing to push for McCarthy to be removed as speaker to prevent him from working across the aisle to pass a short-term government funding bill.   \u201cIf Speaker McCarthy relies on Democrats to pass a continuing resolution, I would call the Capitol moving truck to his office pretty soon because my expectation would be he\u2019d be out of the Speaker\u2019s office quite promptly,\u201d Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of those hardline Republican members, told CNN on Wednesday.  \u201cWe will have a government shutdown, and it is absolutely Speaker McCarthy\u2019s fault,\u201d he added. Taft, California, Mayor Dave Noerr brushed off Gaetz\u2019s fiery quotes, calling it \u201cridiculous.\u201d On the very public pressure facing McCarthy, Noerr told CNN he sees it as part of the bare knuckle fight of Washington, but nothing new for the speaker or the region that raised a young McCarthy.  \u2018Kevin will get this done\u2019 In Bakersfield, he\u2019s not just speaker of the House. He\u2019s known as the son of a firefighter, born and raised in the Central Valley. He is the area\u2019s most famous homegrown national office holder \u2013 community college, college and master\u2019s degree all from this area \u2013 whose less-than-stellar grades would suggest a far less powerful career path. But like the working town that raised him, the lack of polish would impart lessons that guide McCarthy today. \u201cWe\u2019re made up of thick skin,\u201d Noerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re hard working. We are oil and gas, ranching and farming. We are not a ruckus crowd. But we are strong and get it done.\u201d Noerr referred to the intra-party war McCarthy faced to becoming speaker, one that he would ultimately win.  With House Republicans holding a slim majority in the 118th Congress, the now-familiar group of GOP hard-liners prompted a messy and historic floor fight for control of the speaker\u2019s gavel. After voting had spilled into a fifth day, McCarthy broke through by conceding to a series of demands that weakened the power of the speakership.  It\u2019s the sort of compromise that McCarthy understands must happen in governance, said Abernathy.  \u201cPeople talking about trying to bring in moving vans are just fundraising,\u201d said Abernathy, adding Gaetz is trying to \u201ckeep the pot boiling for national attention. Kevin will get this done, one way or another. Anyone who really knows Kevin McCarthy knows he\u2019s up to the task.\u201d Bakersfield conservative Paul Stine has known McCarthy since 1995, battling with him since they were young Republicans. When they first met, Stine considered McCarthy as too centrist, more like Arnold Schwarzenegger than Donald Trump. \u201cKevin can adapt,\u201d Stine said. \u201cBut Matt Gaetz is making it hard for him to adapt this time. Gaetz and the rest are making it hard to get the budget out of the House unless he decides to work with the Democrats.\u201d That sort of political blow to the right wing would be tough for Stine to swallow. But it would follow a characteristic that Stine said has followed McCarthy throughout his professional life \u2013 political survival. Stine said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what his exit plan today is, but he is the most adaptable politician I have ever seen in my life.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T12:25:10Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922222253-01-ukr-counteroffensive-plans.jpg?c=original", "title": "Ukrainian forces have broken through in Verbove, top general says", "content": "The general leading Ukraine\u2019s counteroffensive along the southern front line says his forces have broken through in Verbove \u2013 and predicts an even bigger breakthrough to come. \u201cOn the left flank [near Verbove] we have a breakthrough and we continue to advance further,\u201d Oleksandr Tarnavsky told CNN Senior International Correspondent Frederik Pleitgen during an interview on Friday, though he conceded his troops were moving slower than anticipated. \u201cNot as fast as it was expected, not like in the movies about the Second World War,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main thing is not to lose this initiative (that we have). And, well, not to lose it in practice, with actions.\u201d The general\u2019s claim is the latest indication by Ukrainian officials that inroads are being made on the southern front in the war with Russia.  Ukrainian forces claimed in recent weeks to have penetrated the \u201cfirst line\u201d of Russian strongholds in the Zaporizhzia region, in a sign that Kyiv was edging closer to Moscow\u2019s sprawling network of fortified trenches along the southern front.  Russian-appointed officials in occupied Zaporizhzhia have given a different picture of the fighting. CNN is unable to verify the battlefield reports of either side. However, open-source analysis of available video suggests that some Ukrainian units have crossed through an important line of Russian defenses near the village of Verbove. Ukraine\u2019s long-term goal is to break Russia\u2019s \u201cland bridge,\u201d which links territory it holds in the east with annexed Crimea.  At the beginning of September Ukrainian forces said they had taken the village of Robotyne and were pushing east toward the village of Novoprokopivka. Soldiers said they expected battles for control of high ground to the south and east of the village as they approached the next layer of Russian defenses. Verbove is a few miles east from Robotyne. However, Tarnavsky told CNN he believed the big breakthrough of the counteroffensive would be if Ukraine could take Tokmak, a strategic hub for Russia, which is its first major target in its fight in the south. CNN reported earlier this week that the Ukrainian forces were still some 20 kilometers from Tokmak, struggling to break through the multiple layers of Russian defenses. \u201cI believe yes [there will be a big breakthrough],\u201d Tarnavsky said. \u201cI think it will happen after Tokmak. At the moment (the Russians) are relying on the depth of their defensive line there.\u201d Rather than the \u2018Surovikin line\u2019 \u2013 a defensive line built on the orders of former General Sergey Surovikin, while he was in charge of Russian forces in Ukraine \u2013 Tarnavsky says the bigger issues are the \u201ccrossroads, tree lines and minefields between the tree lines.\u201d    \u201c[There\u2019s] a combination of small harmful enemy defense groups that currently are planted very precisely and competently,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the actions of our fighters force them to slowly pull back when they face our assault squads.\u201d The general conceded that for the counteroffensive to be a success, Ukrainian forces need to at least reach the city of Tokmak.  \u201cTokmak is the minimum goal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overall objective is to get to our state borders.\u201d  \u2018Not as fast as expected\u2019 Despite conceding the advance wasn\u2019t going as \u201cfast as expected,\u201d Tarnavsky said winter would not slow down the counteroffensive. Intense rains in the fall can make the ground in Ukraine soggy and make movement with heavy machinery, like tanks, more difficult, but Tarnavsky says Ukraine\u2019s forces move in small groups, mostly on foot.  \u201cThe weather can be a serious obstacle during advance, but considering how we move forward, mostly without vehicles, I don\u2019t think [the weather] will heavily influence the counteroffensive,\u201d Tarnavsky told Pleitgen in the interview. \u201cRight now, neither the enemy nor us uses large formations, companies, battalions or brigades. We use assault squads, groups of 10 to 15 men,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey conduct titanic work of concentrating enemy fire on them and using all the means they have to use to survive.\u201d One of the reasons for the slow advance, the general said, was the fact that Russia had been able to learn some lessons from other Ukrainian offensives. \u201cThe Russians are learning quite fast, as they don\u2019t have any other choice. If they don\u2019t learn, they will be defeated sooner,\u201d he explained. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they are adapting to our actions, as we also change our tactics.\u201d He said Ukraine had also been adapting to using Western equipment, as well as Western tactics. When asked about rising resistance in the West to continuing weapons supplies to Ukraine, especially in the US, where some have voiced doubt about Kyiv\u2019s chances of success, Tarnavsky said he respected their view.  \u201cLet it be the opinion of the skeptics. It\u2019s not a competition and we don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand somebody may have imagined large scale counteroffensive operations. But times are changing, enemy tactics are changing, weapons change.\u201d  \u201cWe have one goal \u2013 liberation of our territories. However hard it is we will keep on working. And I want to thank even the skeptics, their criticism also influences our task\u2019s success,\u201d he said. He thanked Ukraine\u2019s Western allies for their continuous support and pledged to treat the tanks and armored vehicles they have supplied with great care.  Wagner, \u2018here and there\u2019 During the interview, the general also commented on the current state of the mercenary group Wagner. He said Wagner fighters still pop up \u201chere and there\u201d on the front line following the death of the group\u2019s former boss Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a plane crash last month after leading a failed insurrection that posed the biggest threat to the rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin in decades. A deal struck to de-escalate the crisis was supposed to have sent Prigozhin and his fighters to neighboring Belarus, but there have been reports of Wagner fighters redeploying to Kherson. Asked about those reports, Tarnavsky said, \u201cIn some directions, I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s the Kherson region, or our direction, or somewhere else, they do pop up. The fact is that their badges appear here and there \u2013 that\u2019s been constant.\u201d Tarnavsky went on to say his men usually speculated about the presence of Wagner whenever their enemy started behaving more competently. \u201cWe suspect the presence of Wagner if we see the deterrence of our offensive forces with the involvement of a category of military personnel who perform these tasks in a more interesting (more non-standard) way,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis makes one think: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Wagner has showed up?\u201d\u201c \u201cBut there is no such unit in my area of the front today,\u201d he added. \u201cRegarding Kherson direction \u2013 I can\u2019t say.\u201d Ukraine recently launched a missile attack on the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, in the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed by Moscow\u2019s forces in 2014.  Tarnavsky told CNN that strikes on Crimea are important for the success of Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensive.  \u201cThe success of offensive operations is not only about destroying the enemy in front of you, it\u2019s also about destroying places of concentration of equipment, personnel and especially destroying the command centers,\u201d he said, adding that it can create a \u201ca mess on the battlefield.\u201d The general added striking Crimea was especially important as a rallying cry for Ukrainian forces and to boost morale.  \u201cIt helps us but it also gives us hope for the future,\u201d he said.

Such stories are impossible to verify but are a glimmer of hope people want to cling to. Torrential rainfall and the collapse of two dams flooded the coastal city, sweeping entire neighborhoods into the Mediterranean on September 10. Close to 4,000 people died in the floods and 9,000 more are still unaccounted for, according to the World Health Organization. While the missing are presumed dead, their bodies still trapped under debris or in the sea, many still hope their loved ones could still be alive.    Abu Bakr thought his relatives perished in the catastrophic flood, until he saw a picture on social media of a child rescued from the water that looks like his nephew. It set him on a search mission that took him to field hospitals and shelters for the displaced.  Schools-turned-shelters in Derna list the names of their inhabitants on their doors to help people like Abu Bakr. A stream of people go from one to another to go through the lists every day, hoping to find a familiar name.  In the mayhem of the first few days, survivors, the injured and the displaced were taken to other cities in eastern Libya. People lost their phones and mobile networks were down, making it difficult for survivors to reach their families. Hundreds of bodies were buried in mass graves without visual identification, and officials only managed to take DNA samples of recovered bodies days after the floods hit. Officials say it could take up to a year before these bodies are exhumed for identification.  \u201cMy family thought I was dead and started taking condolences,\u201d Karima El-Kilany, 62, tells CNN. Water flooded her house and her husband clung to a collapsed ceiling until neighbors rescued them. It took days for her to get on Facebook and read the eulogies written for her and her husband, she says.   She sits on a mattress in a school theater-turned-shelter for the displaced. Next to her, Salma, a teacher and mother of four, is tending to her 17-year-old daughter, who\u2019s ill and shell-shocked.   Salma, who only gave her first name and agreed to be filmed covering her face, finds it difficult to accept her new reality. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m too paranoid. There are 30 families in this room,\u201d she says, describing how she struggles to sanitize the mattresses her kids sleep on. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to suddenly find all your neighbors inside your house. Imagine that. If you make problems, then you become suspicious.\u201d  \u201cI hope to wake up one day (and) find the city still standing. Find the people. Find my mother,\u201d Salma says. \u201cI lost my mother, my brother, my sisters. I went back to search for my mother, I went through the names, but nothing. But, I\u2019m hopeful,\u201d she adds.   At a nearby shelter, Salem el-Na\u2019as of the Libyan Red Crescent scrolls through the strangers\u2019 messages on his phone. They are all from people looking for loved ones, sending him names, pictures and details. \u201cThe messages don\u2019t stop. I have to put the phone on flight mode just to be able to write down the information I get,\u201d he says.   The tide turns  These efforts were hampered by another drop in mobile network coverage earlier this week. While the two-day blackout started hours after hundreds of protesters called for accountability on Monday, officials said it was due to infrastructure failure when excavators hit a fiber optics cable.  Grief has morphed into anger. Like the sea slowly regurgitating the houses and lives thrown into its belly, more residents were questioning the negligence and mismanagement that led to the collapse of the two dams. Protesters chanted against Agilah Saleh, the speaker of the eastern-based parliament that also supports the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) that controls the city.    This week ushered a waning of the solidarity that briefly united a country divided by a decade of war. Officials of the eastern-based government were increasingly expressing concerns about \u201cinfiltrators\u201d from the western-based and internationally recognized government and \u201cextremist groups\u201d taking advantage of the aid convoys arriving in the city. Several LNA officials told CNN at least a dozen men were arrested in Derna.   Activists said that several residents and protesters were arrested.  \u201cPolitical division still exist but what\u2019s important (is) that all the relevant institutes are on the ground regardless of where they are based,\u201d Mohamed Eljarh, spokesman of the Supreme Committee of Emergency and Response, said in a press conference Friday. \u201cWe should overcome the political divide on the ground,\u201d he told CNN.  The emergency committee held a meeting with Derna representatives after disbanding the municipal council to include them in the decision making, Eljarh announced on Friday.  \u201cThis is one of the ways to deal with the anger, grievances and concerns,\u201d he told CNN.  Staying put  The city that was buzzing with rescuers, journalists, visiting diplomats and volunteers bringing aid from across Libya, got a lot quieter by the time the CNN team left on Wednesday. Officials said they were worried about the spread of infections especially in areas where dead bodies are believed to be trapped under mud and rubble.   Close to 60 local recovery workers were hospitalized on Tuesday suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, which the minister of health of the eastern-based government said were infections common in such situations. He said at this stage there are no signs of an endemic spreading in the city.     Throughout this week, excavators cleared paths for vehicles through the rubble. Local health workers were spraying the damaged buildings and streets with strong disinfectants.  While officials denied giving city-wide evacuation orders, several areas were cordoned off. Access to the city was restricted and only a handful of regional and international networks, including CNN, were allowed to stay for a few more days.  Yet, in streets ravaged by the floods, residents of the buildings still standing were adamant on staying in their homes. Those who lost their homes, like Salma, want to stay in the city, hoping international aid groups would provide temporary housing.   \u201cWe tried evacuation in 2018. I was displaced from my home and neighborhood for two years. I experienced the destitution that comes with displacement. I paid a high price and there was no compensation,\u201d Moftah Al-Hanshiry says. His building still holds the scars of previous wars and battles that Derna witnessed in the past decade.   Fueled by endemic distrust of local politicians and leaders, he says he would only leave his home if a responsible entity like the World Health Organization issues the order.

The comments by Morawiecki risk deepening the divisions between two countries that have previously been close allies united against Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Tensions between them have been rising in recent weeks over a ban on Ukrainian grain, initially put in place earlier this year by several EU nations to protect the livelihood of local farmers worried about being undercut by the low price of Ukrainian grain. The EU announced plans to suspend the ban last week but Poland \u2013 alongside Hungary and Slovakia \u2013 said it would stick with it, sparking protests from Ukraine, which filed lawsuits against the three countries, and, subsequently, Zelensky\u2019s comments at the UN. Poland immediately condemned Zelensky\u2019s comments at the UN and its foreign ministry summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to convey its \u201cstrong protest.\u201d Hours later, the Polish prime minister said in a blunt social media statement that the country would \u201cno longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland.\u201d That had seemed to indicate a major change in policy: until now, Poland has been one of the most forthright countries in the race to get weapons and resources into Ukrainian hands. But Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday moved to walk back his prime minister\u2019s comments, saying they were \u201cinterpreted in the worst possible way.\u201d He said Morawiecki had merely been referring to new weapons being purchased for the Polish army, and that older weapons systems Warsaw deems not necessary for modernizing its own military could still be shipped across the border. NATO and European sources told CNN that the Polish stance may be an attempt to woo farmers with elections due next month.  Poland has long been one of Ukraine\u2019s staunchest allies, alongside multiple former Eastern bloc nations which fear they could be next if Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s expansionist war is successful. Hungary warns against more Russia sanctions In another sign of disenchantment over Ukraine in Eastern Europe, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said new sanctions against Russia are not needed because they \u201ccause more harm to Europe than Russia.\u201d Szijjarto made the comments in an interview with Russian state media TASS on Friday following his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.  \u201cIf we look at the sanctions from a pragmatic point of view, we see that they cause more harm to Europe than to Russia,\u201d he said, according to TASS, adding that \u201cthe new packages of sanctions are not necessary.\u201d  Szijjarto also said that supplies of Ukrainian grain to Central European countries will destroy their agricultural sector.  \u201cIf Ukrainian grain starts to spread into Central European countries, it will definitely destroy the agricultural markets of Central Europe. Not to mention our farmers, whom we obviously need to protect,\u201d Szijjarto continued, as cited by TASS.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T06:08:25Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230917122144-02-russell-brand-0916.jpg?c=original", "title": "Russell Brand makes first public comments since sexual assault allegations", "content": "Russell Brand has made his first public comments since being accused of rape and sexual assault, thanking followers for \u201cquestioning the information they have been presented with\u201d while not addressing the claims.

Last Saturday, British outlets The Sunday Times, The Times and Channel 4\u2019s \u201cDispatches\u201d published a joint investigation in which four women alleged Brand sexually assaulted them in separate instances between 2006 and 2013. One of the women said she was 16 and Brand was 31 at the time of the alleged assault in London. The women chose not to be identified by name in the report, according to the The Times. CNN has not been able to independently verify their claims. At least two of the alleged assaults took place in Los Angeles. One woman was treated at a rape treatment center the same day as the alleged assault, according to the report.

Biden has been plagued by issues on the border since his first months in office when the US faced a surge of unaccompanied migrant children that caught officials flatfooted. Over the last two years, his administration has continued to face fierce pushback from Republicans \u2013 and at times, Democrats \u2013 over his immigration policies.  That complicated political landscape was put into sharp focus this week when administration officials were forced to contend with images of migrants crossing into the US in large groups, while also heralding a major move that will make hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans already in the US eligible to work, addressing a major sticking point with allies in New York.  But the new wave of newcomers \u2013 many of whom are from Venezuela \u2013 paints a grim outlook for the fall as Biden ramps up his reelection campaign and Republicans continue to hammer the administration over its handling of the border.   On Thursday, Biden blasted Republicans in Congress during remarks at the 46th Annual Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s Gala in Washington, DC, saying they \u201ccontinue to undermine our border security\u201d by blocking bipartisan efforts to pass immigration reform.  \u201cWe need our colleagues to act \u2013 for decades, immigration reform has been bipartisan in this country,\u201d he said.  \u201cUnfortunately, MAGA Republicans in Congress spent four years gutting the immigration system under my predecessor,\u201d he added.  In the absence of immigration reform, the administration has put in place a patchwork of policies to try to stem the flow of migrants journeying to the US southern border amid unprecedented mass migration in the western hemisphere. Earlier this year, the administration rolled out new and additional avenues for migrants to enter the US legally, like a mobile app, to keep people from crossing unlawfully. They have also stood up centers in the hemisphere to allow migrants to apply to come to the US.  But desperation and disinformation from smugglers have prompted migrants to cross anyway. Homeland Security officials are monitoring the situation and while they gave no clear explanation for what prompted the latest surge, they cited poor economies, authoritarian regimes and the climate crisis as forces driving migration.  This week, US Border Patrol apprehended more than 8,000 migrants daily, according to two Homeland Security officials. That\u2019s up from around 3,500 daily border arrests after the Covid-era border restriction known as Title 42 expired in May and triggered more severe consequences for people who crossed the border illegally.  The Department of Homeland Security has ramped up capacity in border facilities to accommodate the growing number of migrants, as well as continued to conduct deportation flights of migrants deemed ineligible to stay in the United States. US officials are also coordinating with Mexico to try to drive down crossings.  Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is set to travel to the border on Saturday, going to McAllen, Texas, for a meeting with President Xiomara Castro of Honduras. The Department of Defense, for its part, is sending 800 new active-duty personnel to the US-Mexico border, in addition to the 2,500 National Guard members already in place, to provide support to federal authorities.  The arrival of migrants at the US southern border also affects inner cities, where asylum seekers usually reside as they go through their immigration proceedings, expanding the scope of the issue for the Biden administration.  The administration addressed a major concern among Democrats this week by making more than 472,000 Venezuelans already in the US eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which provides deportation protections and allows them to work in the US. Democratic allies had urged the White House to speed up the ability for Venezuelans to obtain work authorization so they wouldn\u2019t have to rely on social services.  \u201cAs a result of this decision, immigrants will be temporarily allowed to work, fill needed jobs and support their families while awaiting an asylum determination. The decision will also substantially reduce the cost to New York taxpayers with respect to the sheltering of asylum-seekers,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of whom are New York Democrats, in a statement.

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection says it has a new tool to battle wildfires before they explode \u2013 artificial intelligence. \u201cI think it is a game changer \u2026 It has enhanced our abilities to validate situational awareness and then respond in a quick fashion,\u201d Phillip SeLegue, Cal Fire\u2019s staff chief for fire intelligence, told CNN. Deep in the California wilderness of the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County, a fire started in the middle of a July night. No fire officials were in the area, but AI was watching and alerted the authorities. \u201cThe dispatch center there was not aware of the fire,\u201d said Scott Slumpff, battalion chief of the intel program at Cal Fire, who was testing the new technology at the time and received the initial alert. Cal Fire, in partnership with the University of California at San Diego\u2019s Alert California program and its network of more than 1,000 cameras across the state, is using the technology to spot fires early.  \u201cThe camera had done its 360 [degree turn], identified an anomaly, stopped and was zoomed in,\u201d Slumpff explained. He then confirmed it was a fire and immediately dispatched resources. \u201cThey were able to hold it to a 10 by 10 [foot] spot out in the middle of the forest.\u201d \u201cThe next morning, that fire would have been a fire of significance\u201d without the AI detection, SeLegue said. The cameras, usually placed in the mountains so they have a higher vantage point, are constantly scanning their surroundings in 2-minute rotations; AI looks for any changes which it highlights in a red rectangular box on the screen. \u201cOnce the camera system detects an anomaly, which is a different version of the last image, it red flags it,\u201d said Dean Veik, a fire department liaison for Alert California and a former firefighter. \u201cIt\u2019s predominantly looking for smoke.\u201d The cameras themselves are not new \u2013 Cal Fire has used them for years to watch for fires. They are also publicly accessible: anyone can watch the network of view sheds to see weather conditions in real time or catch a glimpse of a curious creature like a bald eagle using the tower as a perch. After detecting smoke, Cal Fire continues to monitor the video streams for \u201csituational awareness\u201d of a fire \u2013 where it\u2019s heading and whether it is \u201cencroaching on critical infrastructure,\u201d said SeLegue. Law enforcement can even use it to identify suspected arsonists.    The pilot program was so successful, Cal Fire expanded the technology at the beginning of September to all 21 of its dispatch centers across the state. \u201cOur goal as an agency is to keep 95% of our fires at 10 acres or less, so this tool increases our ability to ensure that we\u2019re keeping those fires small in the incipient phase,\u201d said SeLegue, adding the cameras can see about 70 miles out during the day and approximately 110 miles out at night. \u201cWe have multiple successes of fires at night that had gone undetected that we were able to suppress before a 911 call had even come into the command centers.\u201d Cal Fire says 40% of fires since July 10 have been detected by AI before a 911 call was received \u2013 and the technology is continuing to learn and improve.  The system is looking for changes on the horizon, said Alert California\u2019s Brian Norton, who spent 35 years in the fire service. Sometimes it\u2019s going to be smoke from a wildfire. Other times it\u2019s going to be something harmless, like mist or dust.  The trick is teaching the AI to know the difference. \u201cThe learning part of it comes in with the human intervention to say \u2018that looked like smoke, but that wasn\u2019t smoke; it was dust,\u2019\u201d Norton told CNN. \u201cThen the next time the camera picks something up, it\u2019s less likely to say that that is smoke.\u201d  Traditionally, people in the dispatch centers would have to endlessly watch those video feeds looking for \u201ca needle in a haystack,\u201d Slumpff said. \u201cEye fatigue\u201d was always a concern as officials were constantly scanning possibly hundreds of feeds at a time.  Now, with the help of AI, they spend time focusing on the anomalies the technology has detected.  There are also lookout towers throughout the state, some staffed by fire personnel, others with volunteers. At Boucher Hill lookout tower in San Diego County, volunteer Bill Angel of the Forest Fire Lookout Association is in his second season of keeping an eye out for wildfires. His tower is just a few yards away from where the cameras are positioned on a communications tower. The AI technology has \u201cenhanced looking for fires but it still requires humans,\u201d he said while keeping watch over the vast valley below, often raising his binoculars to his eyes. \u201cIf lightning strikes the tower, they\u2019re blind but we are here.\u201d  The firefighters agree, convinced this new technology is making a difference \u2013 and won\u2019t threaten human jobs. \u201cNothing can take the place of the boots on the ground,\u201d said Slumpff. \u201cWe absolutely are able to, in my opinion, save lives and property.\u201d \u201cThe fires you don\u2019t hear about in the news is the greatest success,\u201d SeLegue said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T10:02:36Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922191401-ron-desantis-06262023.jpg?c=original", "title": "As DeSantis falters, the race for second place in the GOP primary is open again", "content": "A furious scramble for second place is underway in the crowded Republican primary contest, with candidates vying for an opportunity to directly take on front-runner Donald Trump. The position, once held by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, now appears to be more of a free-for-all. Since the 2024 presidential race began, the second-place spot in GOP primary polling has been a coveted one. The conventional wisdom was that for candidates not named Trump, one of their earliest objectives would be to become the consensus alternative to the former president. Before and in the early days of DeSantis\u2019 campaign, it seemed like he would be that candidate. The Florida governor enjoyed a robust campaign war chest and early polling showed him trailing only Trump, albeit by a wide margin.  But more recently, DeSantis\u2019s star has begun to fade. He was more muted compared with other rivals at last month\u2019s first Republican primary debate in Milwaukee, and he\u2019s now polling at similar levels to several other non-Trump contenders.  A new CNN/University of New Hampshire poll of likely GOP primary voters in the Granite State found a close contest for second place between entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and DeSantis. With the second GOP debate only days away, Haley has been gaining ground with Republican moderates, according to surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, and is increasingly trying to distinguish herself on both fiscal and foreign policy.  \u201cWe need a leader who will stand up to Democrats and Republicans,\u201d the former governor said Friday as she unveiled her economic policy in an address at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire. \u201cRepublicans talk a big game, but they\u2019re nearly as reckless as the Democrats on spending.\u201d Her strong showing at the Milwaukee debate, particularly the exchanges with Ramaswamy, gained her the admiration of voters like Tom Boyer, who came to see her speak Friday. \u201cI appreciated what she said and agreed with her wholeheartedly,\u201d Boyer told CNN. \u201cI like the fact that she\u2019s in favor of supporting Ukraine, and some of her Republican opponents are not. I like her economic plan. I like her reasoning.\u201d Boyer, a longtime New Jersey resident who retired to New Hampshire, said he also was drawn to Christie\u2019s candidacy but believes Haley has a better path to victory. \u201cIf the problems Trump is having bring him down a little bit, I like her more than any of the other candidates,\u201d Boyer said. The GOP race will also be driven by voters like Thalia Floras, who said she intends to shed her Democratic Party registration next week in New Hampshire and become an undeclared voter. She said she ultimately intends to take part in the Republican primary and is considering Haley, Christie or former Texas Rep. Will Hurd. She said her chief goal was to find the strongest contender against Trump. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cI will support the candidate that could potentially slow or stop Trump.\u201d Hoping for a stumble It\u2019s not unheard of for the overarching theme of a presidential primary to be about one consistent front-runner and a revolving door of alternatives. In the 2012 cycle, Mitt Romney enjoyed front-runner billing but his top rival changed throughout the primary. At one point, it was Newt Gingrich. At another point, it seemed like Rick Perry was Romney\u2019s biggest threat. At yet another point, it was Rick Santorum. This cycle is shaping up to be similar to that, said Kyle Plotkin, a veteran Republican campaign strategist.   \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to get a second look to be second place,\u201d Plotkin said.   For much of the rest of the field, that\u2019s a big part of the gamble in running against Trump in this primary. Despite a bevy of indictments and a refusal to participate in the first two Republican presidential debates, Trump\u2019s polling lead over the rest of the field has only grown and he\u2019s enjoyed fundraising windfalls. Whether they admit it or not, other campaigns are betting that some unforeseen event will knock the former president\u2019s momentum, said David Urban, a former senior adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and a CNN contributor.  \u201cI think everyone\u2019s kind of rowing their boat in that direction, hoping there will be a stumble at some point. That somehow, in some place along the way, the former president stumbles and he then gets knocked off the horse and then somebody else is next. Positioning for being next is the best thing you can hope for at this point,\u201d Urban said. \u201cNobody\u2019s closing the gap. The gap has not been closed. And so since that gap has not been closed, the thesis on \u2018I\u2019m going to run to be first\u2019 -well, running to be first ain\u2019t working. It\u2019s not working. It\u2019s not playing out. So running to be second seems to be the next best thing. And that\u2019s all you can do.\u201d So far, it isn\u2019t clear what that stumble would be. Trump has been seemingly impervious to the consequences of the tactical slip-ups the other candidates have experienced. That\u2019s left the debates as key moments to break through for the rest of the field, argued Republican strategist Brett Doster.  \u201cI think that the DeSantis campaign has made every rookie mistake you possibly could make for a presidential candidate, but he\u2019s still the one to beat among the non-Trump candidates because of the money factor,\u201d Doster said. \u201cI think this upcoming debate is going to be interesting because it looks like there may be a smaller field. And I think it\u2019s going to be a decisive moment for either (former Vice President Mike) Pence or Vivek or Nikki Haley to make their move.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T10:01:37Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922183421-05-sevastopol-smoke-092223.jpg?c=original", "title": "Ukraine says strike on Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet HQ left dozens dead and wounded \u2018including senior leadership\u2019", "content": "Ukraine said Saturday its bold strike on Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet headquarters in the Crimean city of Sevastopol had left dozens dead and wounded \u201cincluding senior leadership.\u201d The attack on Friday is perhaps the most dramatic example yet of the confidence with which Ukraine is going after Russian facilities in occupied Crimea \u2013 and shows the vulnerability of critically important infrastructure on the peninsula.

Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense has to date only said that a Russian soldier was missing after Friday\u2019s missile attack, which local authorities said left the naval HQ damaged scattered debris hundreds of meters away. The incident was the latest in a string of attacks targeting Russian facilities in Crimea.  The Ukrainians have hit a Russian military airfield at Saky, degraded Russian air defenses on the north-west coast, and carried out a missile attack on the main dry-dock and ship-repair facility in Sevastopol, crippling an attack submarine and a landing ship. The attack on Saky caused unspecified but \u201cserious damage\u201d at the airfield, according to sources in Ukraine\u2019s Security Services (SBU). In the wake of Friday\u2019s attack, Ukraine\u2019s Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksii Danilov warned that the Russian Black Sea Fleet could be \u201csliced up like a salami\u201d in potential future strikes.  There are plenty of reasons for Ukraine to target Crimea. It\u2019s politically a sign that despite the slow progress on the front lines in its counteroffensive, Ukraine can still inflict serious damage on the Russian military. Targets such as the Crimea bridge have considerable symbolic value as well as strategic purpose. It\u2019s also part of a broader effort \u2013 in Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 to hit Russian logistics, fuel, maintenance and command centers, in order to disrupt their ability to supply the front lines.

A prosecutor initially declined to bring charges against any first responder in connection with McClain\u2019s death following his encounter with police in the Colorado city of Aurora, citing what he said was a lack of evidence against them, infuriating his family and civil rights advocates. McClain, a massage therapist, was confronted by police officers on August 24, 2019, after someone reported seeing a person wearing a ski mask who \u201clooks sketchy.\u201d After officers wrestled him to the ground and paramedics injected him with a potent sedative, McClain suffered a heart attack on the way to a hospital and died days later, authorities said. Body camera video of the encounter shows McClain at some point saying he couldn\u2019t breathe \u2013 a plea echoed by George Floyd in May 2020 when a Minneapolis officer kneeled on his neck for several minutes before Floyd, a Black man, took his last breath. Floyd\u2019s murder and Breonna Taylor\u2019s killing by police in Louisville, Kentucky, in March 2020 reignited calls for charges in McClain\u2019s case as millions of people around the world swarmed the streets, protesting police violence against people of color, particularly Black Americans. Ultimately, the public pressure led Colorado\u2019s governor to order a review of the case.  After the investigation, a Colorado grand jury in 2021 indicted five first responders \u2013 including Aurora police Officer Randy Roedema and a former officer, Jason Rosenblatt, who are on trial now \u2013 on charges including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Aurora police Officer Nathan Woodyard is scheduled to be tried separately next month. Two paramedics who administered ketamine to McClain are expected to stand trial in November. All five defendants have pleaded not guilty. After learning of the charges in 2021, McClain\u2019s parents were brought to tears. \u201cI started crying because it\u2019s been two years,\u201d his mother, Sheneen McClain, said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey.\u201d Here is a timeline of how the case reached trial four years after McClain\u2019s death. August 2019  Three White officers stopped McClain in Aurora on August 24, 2019, while he was walking home from a convenience store in the Denver suburb after 10:30 p.m., according to a police overview of the incident. Carrying iced tea in a plastic bag, McClain eventually was in a physical struggle with the officers after, police say, he resisted arrest.  Early in the encounter, an officer told McClain to stop, and when McClain kept walking, two officers grabbed his arms, the overview reads. McClain says, \u201cLet me go \u2026 I\u2019m an introvert, please respect the boundaries that I am speaking,\u201d according to body camera footage from one of the officers.  After an officer asked him to cooperate so they could talk, McClain tells officers he had been trying to pause his music so he could hear them, and tells them to let him go, the overview reads.  Eventually, one officer is heard telling another that McClain tried to grab his gun. All three officers tackled McClain to the ground, and Woodyard placed him in a carotid hold \u2013 in which an officer uses their biceps and forearm to cut off blood flow to a subject\u2019s brain \u2013 police said in the overview document. McClain briefly became unconscious, and Woodyard released the hold, the document reads, citing the officers. Because the hold was used, department policy compelled the officers to call the fire department for help, authorities said. Aurora Fire Rescue paramedics arrived and saw McClain on the ground and resisting officers, the overview says. Paramedic Jeremy Cooper diagnosed McClain with \u201cexcited delirium\u201d and decided to inject him with the powerful sedative ketamine, the overview says.  McClain suffered a heart attack on the way to a hospital, authorities said. Three days later, he was declared brain-dead and taken off life support.  November 2019  The Adams County coroner\u2019s office submitted an autopsy report on November 7, stating the cause and manner of death were \u201cundetermined.\u201d The report cited the scene investigation and examination findings as factors leading to that conclusion.  Roughly two weeks later, the Adams County district attorney, Dave Young, declined to file criminal charges against any of the first responders. In a letter to the Aurora police chief on November 22, Young referred to the undetermined cause of death as one of the factors.  \u201cThe evidence does not support a conclusion that Mr. McClain\u2019s death was the direct result of any particular action of any particular individual,\u201d Young wrote. \u201cUnder the circumstances of this investigation, it is improbable for the prosecution to prove cause of death beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury of twelve. Consequently, the evidence does not support the prosecution of a homicide.\u201d  Also on November 22, after the district attorney\u2019s decision, Aurora police released the officers\u2019 body camera videos.  \u201cWe did this because obviously we think it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d then-Police Chief Nick Metz said during a news conference after the video was shown to reporters. Metz also offered condolences to McClain\u2019s family: \u201cWe certainly recognize and understand that this has been an incredibly devastating and difficult process for them over these last several weeks.\u201d  February 2020 A police review board concluded that the use of force against McClain, including the carotid hold, \u201cwas within policy and consistent with training.\u201d City officials announced on February 6 they would hire an independent expert to review the case.  June 2020 On June 9, Aurora police and city officials announced changes to police policies, including a ban on carotid holds.  Ten says later, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed police accountability legislation into law, requiring all officers to use activated body cameras or dashboard cameras during service calls or officer-initiated public interactions. The measure also barred officers from using chokeholds.  In a pivotal move, Polis signed an executive order appointing Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser to investigate McClain\u2019s case, the governor announced on June 25.  The governor\u2019s decision came after more than 2 million people signed a petition urging officials to conduct a new investigation.  Earlier in June, the three officers who confronted McClain were assigned to administrative duties, primarily due to safety concerns because police and city employees were receiving threats, a police spokesperson said.  On June 27, protesters in the Aurora area gathered on Highway 225, temporarily shutting it down in a demonstration calling for justice in McClain\u2019s death. On June 30, the US attorney\u2019s office for Colorado, the US Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division and the FBI\u2019s Denver division announced they have been reviewing the case since 2019 for potential federal civil rights violations.  July 2020  Aurora police on July 3 fired two officers who they say snapped selfie photographs at McClain\u2019s memorial site, located where he was killed, while they were on duty.  Jason Rosenblatt \u2013 the former officer now on trial \u2013 also was fired, with police saying he received the photo in a text and replied, \u201cha ha,\u201d and did not notify supervisors. The photos were taken on October 20, 2019.  A third officer seen in the photos resigned days before a pre-disciplinary hearing, police said.  On July 20, the Aurora City Council approved a resolution for an independent investigation of McClain\u2019s death to proceed.  August 2020  The McClain family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city of Aurora on August 11.  \u201cAurora\u2019s unconstitutional conduct on the night of August 24, 2019, is part of a larger custom, policy, and practice of racism and brutality, as reflected by its conduct both before and after its murder of Elijah McClain, a young Black man,\u201d the lawsuit stated.  On the same day, Aurora city officials announced the police department would undergo a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d by external experts on civil rights and public safety.  February 2021 Aurora city officials released a 157-page report on February 22, detailing the findings of the independent investigation it commissioned into McClain\u2019s death.  The report asserted that officers did not have the legal basis to stop, frisk or restrain McClain. It also criticized emergency medical responders\u2019 decision to inject him with ketamine and rebuked the police department for failing to seriously question the officers after the death.  Sheneen McClain, Elijah\u2019s mother, cried while reading the report. \u201cIt was overwhelming knowing my son was innocent the entire time and just waiting on the facts and proof of it,\u201d Sheneen McClain told CNN at the time. \u201cMy son\u2019s name is cleared now. He\u2019s no longer labeled a suspect. He is actually a victim.\u201d Elijah McClain\u2019s father said the report only confirmed what the family already knew. \u201cThe Aurora police and medics who murdered my son must be held accountable,\u201d LaWayne Mosley said  after the report\u2019s release.  In response to the report, city officials began work on establishing an independent monitor to scrutinize police discipline, Aurora City Manager Jim Twombly said.  \u201cI believe the investigative team has identified the issue that is at the root of the case: the failure of a system of accountability,\u201d Twombly said after the report\u2019s release.  September 2021 On September 1, the state attorney general announced a grand jury indicted the three officers \u2013 Roedema, Rosenblatt and Woodyard \u2013 and the two paramedics, Peter Cichuniec and Cooper. Each was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide as part of a 32-count indictment. Roedema and Rosenblatt also were indicted on one count of assault and one count of crime of violence. And Cooper and Cichuniec were also  indicted on three counts of assault and six counts of crime of violence. \u201cOur goal is to seek justice for Elijah McClain, for his family and friends and for our state,\u201d Weiser, the state attorney general, said. \u201cIn so doing, we advance the rule of law and our commitment that everyone is accountable and equal under the law.\u201d McClain\u2019s father, Mosley, wept after hearing about the indictment, his attorney said in a news release. \u201cNothing will bring back my son, but I am thankful that his killers will finally be held accountable,\u201d Mosley said through the attorney\u2019s release. On September 15, the Colorado attorney general\u2019s office released a 112-page report that found the Aurora police had a pattern of practicing racially biased policing, excessive force, and had failed to record legally required information when interacting with the community. The report also found the police department used force against people of color almost 2.5 times more than against White people. The state investigation also revealed the fire department had a pattern and practice of administering ketamine illegally, the attorney general\u2019s office said.  The city and the attorney general\u2019s office had 60 days to negotiate a consent decree that would mandate changes to resolve the issues, the office said. November 2021  The state attorney general\u2019s office and the city of Aurora agreed November 16 on terms of a consent decree to address the issues raised in the office\u2019s report two months earlier. On November 19, the city finalized an agreement to pay $15 million to McClain\u2019s family to settle the federal civil rights lawsuit.  September 2022  The cause of death in McClain\u2019s case was changed in light of evidence from the grand jury\u2019s investigation, according to an amended autopsy report publicly released September 23.  The initial autopsy report had said the cause of death was undetermined.  The amended report   now listed \u201ccomplications of ketamine administration following forcible restraint\u201d as the cause of death.  The manner of death remained undetermined in the amended report. \u201cSimply put, this dosage of ketamine was too much for this individual and it resulted in an overdose, even though the blood ketamine level was consistent with a \u2018therapeutic\u2019 concentration,\u201d pathologist Dr. Stephen Cina wrote in the amended autopsy report.  \u201cI believe that Mr. McClain would most likely be alive but for the administration of ketamine.\u201d Cina could not determine whether the carotid hold contributed to the death, but \u201cI have seen no evidence that injuries inflicted by the police contributed,\u201d he wrote. The amended report was signed by the Adams County chief coroner, Monica Broncucia-Jordan, with a July 15, 2021, date handwritten beside her name.  It was made publicly available in September 2022 after a court approved the release. The coroner had said she needed court approval to release it because she was barred from revealing information from the grand jury.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T08:12:17Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921101407-04-nagorno-karabakh-russia-ceasefire.jpg?c=original", "title": "Azerbaijan has reclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh. What does that mean for the tens of thousands living there?", "content": "The same day that Azerbaijan celebrated the surrender of separatist Armenian fighters in Nagorno-Karabakh, many in the breakaway region\u2019s capital spent the evening throwing stacks of paper onto a fire. \u201cOne of the main things that people were doing in Stepanakert was burning all the possible documentation that could become evidence for the Azerbaijani authorities that they personally were part of the de facto government,\u201d Olesya Vartanyan, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst for the South Caucasus, told CNN. \u201cThey believe that this could lead to their persecution,\u201d she said. The ceasefire may have ended the latest brief but bloody conflict fought for control of the region, but there are fears a fresh humanitarian disaster is just beginning. Azerbaijan has said it plans to \u201creintegrate\u201d Nagorno-Karabakh, but how this happens without a mass exodus of the region\u2019s more than 120,000 ethnic Armenians, or without violence being committed against those who stay and attempt to resist Azerbaijani rule, is unclear. Azerbaijan said it had regained full control of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic-Armenian enclave within its borders, after launching a lightning 24-hour assault on Tuesday that killed at least 200 people and injured many hundreds more. Karabakh officials said their forces were outnumbered and had no choice but to surrender. Whether this leads to a lasting peace is not yet clear. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally considered part of Azerbaijan but for decades has been under the control of Armenian separatists. Armenia and Azerbaijan have already fought two wars over Nagorno-Karabakh since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and ceasefire agreements between them have proven brittle. While this ceasefire may have saved Karabakh from the sort of bloodbath seen in previous wars, it has utterly upended the lives of ethnic Armenians in the region, who now face an uncertain future. Whereas the 2020 ceasefire called on both sides to lay down their weapons, Wednesday\u2019s agreement was far more comprehensive. Nagorno-Karabakh\u2019s presidential office said it had agreed to the \u201ccomplete disarmament of its armed forces.\u201d But officials from Baku have demanded more, calling for \u201cthe dissolution of the puppet regime\u201d in Nagorno-Karabakh, which has for decades been ruled by a de facto government not recognized by Azerbaijan or any other country, including Armenia. Azerbaijan\u2019s President Ilham Aliyev has long been explicit about the choice that confronts Karabakh officials. In a speech delivered in May, he told Karabakh Armenians they needed to \u201cbend their necks\u201d and accept full integration into Azerbaijan. Baku sent representatives to meet with Karabakh officials in the city of Yevlakh on Thursday, \u201cto discuss reintegration issues.\u201d  Few details were released about the meeting, ahead of which Aliyev said of the Karabakh Armenians that \u201call their rights will be guaranteed.\u201d The Azeri delegation said the talks had been \u201cheld in a constructive and positive environment,\u201d and had focused on the humanitarian situation, especially the need for fuel and food. \u201cTheir requests were well received. The heating systems of kindergartens and schools, emergency medical aid and firefighting equipment, fuel and humanitarian aid will be supplied,\u201d the delegation said, according to the national news agency AZA. There are fears over what \u201creintegration\u201d entails, however. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and international experts have repeatedly warned of the risk of ethnic cleansing of Armenians in the enclave. The United Nations secretary-general \u201cremains deeply concerned about the impact of the escalation on the humanitarian situation,\u201d UN senior political official Miroslav Jenca said in a speech at the UN Security Council on Thursday.  Unable to leave Nagorno-Karabakh has been under blockade for nine months. In December 2022, Azerbaijan-backed activists established a military checkpoint along the Lachin corridor,  the only route connecting Armenia to the region, preventing the import of food and prompting fears that residents were being left to starve. The blockade has also prevented humanitarian organizations and foreign media from accessing the region, meaning that it is difficult to independently verify reports of further Azerbaijani attacks and the movement of the Armenian population. Siranush Sargsyan, a journalist in Nagorno-Karabakh, told CNN she could hear \u201cintensive\u201d shelling from a suburb in Stepanakert Thursday, while the negotiations between Karabakh and Baku officials were ongoing. \u201cMost of the population were in panic, running and frightened,\u201d she said. Following the truce, thousands of Karabakh residents reportedly fled to the airport, where Russian peacekeepers have a base. Sargsyan also said \u201cthere are more than 20 villages under siege\u201d in the more rural areas of Nagorno-Karabakh. \u201cThere is no electricity and phone connection doesn\u2019t operate, so we don\u2019t know if our relatives are safe.\u201d Olesya Vartanyan said the movement of Azerbaijani troops into these areas displaced thousands. \u201cThese people, they don\u2019t have a place to live. Many of them are in the streets,\u201d she said. While many Armenians, fearing further escalation, have already made up their minds to leave, Vartanyan said it is unclear who will organize routes out of the country, if the Lachin blockade is finally lifted. \u201cWill it be Russian peacekeepers, the ICRC, or will it be Azerbaijani authorities?\u201d she said. \u201cThen, does it mean people will have to go through filtration camps? And then will people get detained \u2013 for example, the local men who took part in the fighting in the past, or those who were part of the local de facto authorities?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess.\u201d It is also unclear where Karabakh Armenians will travel to, if evacuations are able to begin. \u201cThe Government of Armenia doesn\u2019t seek the displacement of the Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh and believes that the rights of Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to live safely and in dignity in their homes must be guaranteed,\u201d Pashinyan\u2019s office told state media Armenpress Thursday. But, if this is \u201cimpossible, the necessary decisions will be taken,\u201d the statement added, without adding further details. \u2018This is my home\u2019 Farid Shafiyev, chair of the Center of Analysis of International Relations in Baku, told CNN that the choice confronting Armenians who chose to stay was clear. \u201cThose who don\u2019t want to accept Azerbaijani jurisdiction, they have to leave. Those who would like to stay and get the passports, they are welcome to stay,\u201d said Shafiyev, whose center was involved in Baku\u2019s plans for \u201creintegration.\u201d Asked whether she would also attempt to evacuate, Sargsyan said she wanted to stay in Stepanakert as long as possible. \u201cBut if they attack again I don\u2019t know what we will do,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I know is I can\u2019t trust them, their fake promises.\u201d Beyond the immediate attempt to provide shelter and other aid to the thousands of Armenians attempting to flee Nagorno-Karabakh, there is the question of how Baku intends to dissolve existing institutions in the region and erect its own. \u201cThis is an entity that has been self-governing as a de facto state. Prior to that it was part of Soviet Azerbaijan. It has a very long experience and practice of autonomy,\u201d Anna Ohanyan, a senior scholar in the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN. Ohanyan warned that attempting to tear down existing institutions, which Baku has claimed it intends to, would be \u201can attack on the capacities for genuine peace-building down the road. If Azerbaijan was genuine about integrating, there would be some integration of these institutions.\u201d More gravely, Ohanyan warned there is \u201cno question\u201d that Azerbaijan would use force, if Armenians in the enclave refused to accept Azerbaijani citizenship. \u201cIf the Armenian community will not leave, but also will not take up Azerbaijani passports, I think that basically would be suicidal,\u201d Ohanyan told CNN. The best case scenario, according to Ohanyan, would be \u201ca Potemkin village\u2026 to continue to gaslight the West,\u201d referring to fake settlements once used to impress the Russian empress Catherine the Great.  \u201cBut in the long term, I think there will be a systematic push, continued demographic engineering to push Armenian communities outside the region.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T07:29:25Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922145055-04-poland-ukraine-europe-relations.jpg?c=original", "title": "Poland\u2019s spat with Ukraine angered many in Europe, and was a gift for Putin", "content": "Europe\u2019s support for Ukraine faced an unexpected curveball this week as Poland \u2013 hitherto Kyiv\u2019s staunchest ally on the continent \u2013 seemed to declare it would stop sending arms to its neighbor. The move came after Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized Warsaw for continuing to ban Ukrainian grain imports, and is the latest example of more confrontational behavior from Poland\u2019s government toward Kyiv, just ahead of a tight general election in the country. The political theater has raised a number of important questions, most important among them, will this be the moment that Europe\u2019s steadfast resolve against Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion finally cracks? So how did a dispute over grain imports escalate into a diplomatic crisis? The European Union placed a temporary ban on grain imports from Ukraine in May, to avoid a bottleneck of cheap grain that risked undercutting farmers in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia. The EU suspended the ban last week, angering those countries, who vowed to keep restrictions in place, and in turn sparking protests from Poland. Poland is weeks away from a national election on October 15 in which the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) is expected to suffer losses. Anyone who follows European politics will tell you that agriculture is incredibly important. Farmers are motivated political agents and citizens tend to care about food security, sometimes disproportionately and irrationally. And the PiS will need rural votes to remain in power. It therefore makes sense that the Polish government would want to make a tub-thumping, headline-grabbing, nationalist gesture. However, this relatively marginal spat spiraled out of control on Tuesday when Zelensky told the UN general assembly: \u201cIt is alarming to see how some in Europe, some of our friends in Europe, play out solidarity in a political theater \u2013 making a thriller from the grain.\u201d Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki responded on social media the next day, saying: \u201cWe no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland.\u201d Poland has since moved to walk back those comments, promising that it will still send weapons it has already committed to provide. Polish President Andrzej Duda has said his prime minister\u2019s words were \u201cinterpreted in the worst possible way.\u201d  The dispute raised important questions about European unity. The first and most important point, however, is that no European officials seriously believe that there is about to be a dramatic change in policy when it comes to supporting Ukraine \u2013 especially from Poland. \u201cThis is all elections blabla\u2026 farmers are a PiS constituency,\u201d says a senior European defense source. \u201cPoland will continue to provide arms to Ukraine. As long as it takes. I have no doubts about that,\u201d says a NATO official. \u201cPoles have a vital interest in Ukraine winning this war as otherwise they will be exposed to their arch enemy (Russia) directly, but they have to play muscles now because of the elections,\u201d says an EU official. Despite the expectation that this is all noise aimed at a domestic audience, it is hard to overstate the level of anger at Poland. A senior EU diplomat told CNN: \u201cUkraine already offered Poland a solution on grain. Which is why they\u2019re so pissed off at Poland. As are 24 member states who have been bullied for 18 months by Poland for not doing enough to support Ukraine.\u201d This sentiment was echoed by sources at NATO, within the EU institutions and from national capitals across Europe.  The contempt is perhaps best characterized by one EU Commission official, who said: \u201cIt needs to be seen in the context of the upcoming elections, the nationalist agenda of the current government and aggressive stances on the grain issue, migration and anything they see as a \u2018threat\u2019 to national interests of Poland. \u201cThey also attack Brussels and the EU when it fits their agenda. It\u2019s a desperate effort to mobilize the voter \u2013 if you have no substance to offer then you start to create and blame an outside enemy to cover up for domestic policy failures.\u201d The most serious takeaway from all of this is what it might mean for Ukraine in the long-term. The West is currently making a great effort to fold Ukraine into its institutions. The country is currently trying to join both the EU and NATO, for which it has unanimous support. That support, however, already comes with caveats and conditions. Most EU member states accept that in order to accommodate Ukraine, there will need to be substantial reform to how the EU operates.  If Ukraine were to join as things stand, lots of the funding that currently goes to member states in the form of subsidies \u2013 including for agriculture \u2013 would instead go to Ukraine. Try selling that to Polish farmers. The current EU structures would also give its newest member massive influence in the institutions, namely the parliament and council of member states. When it comes to NATO, there are members of the alliance who don\u2019t love the idea of a country literally at war having access to the article 5 mechanism \u2013 the \u201call for one and one for all\u201d trigger that impels allies to support one another. For a military alliance, many of the NATO countries don\u2019t particularly like spending money on defense for themselves, let alone each other. Poland\u2019s arms tantrum allows countries who feel they have been strong-armed \u2013 not least by Poland \u2013 to support Ukraine can now legitimately push back on the wisdom of the West throwing so much support to a country that is not even in the alliance. The final reason that officials across Europe are furious about this week\u2019s events is that it hands Russian President Vladimir Putin a propaganda coup. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, when asked about the spat, used it to say \u201cthere are certain tensions between Warsaw and Kyiv. We predict that these tensions will increase.\u201d Russia\u2019s misinformation war is often described by diplomats as a zero-sum game: what is bad for the West is good for Russia. Public spats between the West makes it easy to claim that the West is divided, and a divided West is certainly a good thing for the Kremlin.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T07:25:13Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922180615-new-orleans-drinking-water-shortage.jpg?c=original", "title": "Army Corps of Engineers to barge 36 million gallons of freshwater a day as saltwater intrusion threatens New Orleans-area drinking water", "content": "The US Army Corps of Engineers is planning to barge 36 million gallons of freshwater daily into the lower Mississippi River near New Orleans as saltwater intrusion from the Gulf of Mexico continues to threaten drinking water supply, officials said Friday.  The move comes as water levels are plummeting for the second consecutive year after this summer\u2019s blistering heat and low rainfall triggered extreme drought over parts of the central US.  As water levels drop, the threat of saltwater intrusion grows in Louisiana as ocean water pushes north into drinking water systems, unimpeded by the Mississippi\u2019s normally mighty flow rate.  The Mississippi River is forecast to reach \u201chistoric lows over the next several weeks,\u201d  Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said during a Friday news conference.   To help mitigate intrusion, the state and the Army Corps of Engineers are working to add 25 feet of height to a 1,500-foot-wide underwater levee in the Mississippi River, which was constructed in July to slow the saltwater\u2019s progression, Army Col. Cullen Jones said. The corps also plans to barge millions of gallons of water daily to local water treatment facilities, Jones said during the news conference.  The corps announced the plan to build the levee last year. It involved dredging sediment from the bottom of the river and pile it up to create what\u2019s known as a sill, which acts as a dam for the denser saltwater in the lower levels of the river. Typically, enough rainfall upstream helps ease drought conditions and keeps the saltwater at bay. However, during the news conference Friday, the governor said officials \u201cdon\u2019t believe that there is sufficient precipitation in the near term anywhere along the Mississippi River to materially change the conditions for the better.\u201d  \u201cUnfortunately, we just haven\u2019t had the relief from the dry conditions that we need and so that inclusion is worsening,\u201d Edwards said. State to deliver bottled water in bulk to New Orleans Jones said it will take approximately 24 days to add to the sill. Once augmented, it will delay saltwater intrusion by 10 to 15 days, he said.  Fifteen million gallons of freshwater is expected to be brought in as soon as next week, Jones said, adding the area will need 36 million gallons per day to help mitigate the problem. The water will be added to water at treatment centers and create a mixture that is safe for treatment, Jones added.  The governor also announced plans to deliver bottled water in bulk to the New Orleans area. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell signed an emergency declaration for the city on Friday due to saltwater intrusion.   The declaration allows city agencies to prepare and respond to any impacts and allows state and federal agencies to deploy resources as needed for a more streamlined process, the city said.   Last week, Plaquemines Parish President W. Keith Hinkley said at a news conference that clean water was being distributed to around 2,000 residents who were impacted by the saltwater intrusion.  It was not necessary to buy large amounts of bottled water, Edwards said Friday.   \u201cThere is not a shortage of bottled water around the state or around the country and our businesses are going to be able to bring in water as it\u2019s needed,\u201d he said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T07:13:19Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230918151339-fast-food-burgers-mcdonalds-burger-king-wendys.jpg?c=original", "title": "Burgers and tacos don\u2019t look like they do in ads. Lawsuits are trying to change that", "content": "When it comes to food advertising, what you see is rarely what you get. A flurry of recent lawsuits wants to change that.  Over the past few years, lawyers have been bringing class action suits against fast food companies, alleging that they\u2019re misrepresenting food in their marketing.  Lawyers James Kelly and Anthony Russo, in particular, have been leading the charge, bringing cases against Taco Bell, Wendy\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and Arby\u2019s. These companies use ads that don\u2019t match up with their actual food, the suits allege.   As evidence, the complaints feature images of food marketing alongside shots of their real-life counterparts. In the ads, burgers look tall, heaped with meat and cheese, topped with golden, rounded buns. But in the photos of burgers bought from a real fast food location, they\u2019re flat, with meat and cheese barely peeking out of limp, white buns. Tacos are no different: In Taco Bell\u2019s ads, Crunchwraps look hearty and plump. In photos in the lawsuit, they look flat and nearly empty. The suits are ongoing.  \u201cWe saw a record number of food litigation lawsuits filed from 2020 to 2023, with hundreds of new suits every year,\u201d said Tommy Tobin, a lawyer at Perkins Coie and Lecturer at UCLA Law, adding that \u201cfood litigation is a fast-growing area of law.\u201d  The explosion has been largely driven by the efforts of a handful of lawyers, including Russo and Kelly, said Bonnie Patten, executive director of Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization that focuses on protecting consumers from false advertising. Their cases focus on quantity, she said, essentially arguing that food in ads appears more bountiful than what customers actually get. Other lawyers, like Spencer Sheehan, focus on how food is described. Sheehan, a New York lawyer, has filed hundreds of class action suits focusing on misleading words on packaged foods \u2014 like use of the word \u201cvanilla\u201d on foods made with little or no actual vanilla.   Major chains have also been targeted for how they describe food. Last year a class action suit was brought against Starbucks claiming that the chain is misleading buyers of its \u201cRefreshers\u201d beverages by naming them for ingredients they don\u2019t have. The complaint states that, for example, \u201cthe Mango Dragonfruit and Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade Refreshers contain no mango,\u201d and that in fact \u201call of the products are predominantly made with water, grape juice concentrate, and sugar.\u201d Starbucks argued, among other things, that the fruits mentioned indicate a flavor rather than an ingredient. \u201cThe allegations in the complaint are inaccurate and without merit,\u201d a Starbucks spokesperson said in a statement, adding, \u201cwe look forward to defending ourselves against these claims.\u201d For a judge or jury to side with the plaintiffs in false advertising claims, lawyers have to successfully make the case that the ads would trick a \u201creasonable consumer,\u201d Tobin, explained.  \u201cUnder this standard, a court asks whether a reasonable consumer would be misled by the product\u2019s marketing or labeling,\u201d he said.  The courts will have to draw the line between false advertising and just, well, advertising \u2014 which might be trickier than it sounds.  What is a reasonable consumer? Burger King, in a bid to dismiss the lawsuit against it, argued that its ads are fair.  \u201cReasonable consumers viewing food advertising know\u201d that food in ads \u201chas been styled to make it look as appetizing as possible,\u201d Burger King argued in a recent filing. That \u201cinnate\u201d knowledge, plus the fact that a Whopper patty is always made with a quarter pound of beef, as promised, means that the ads are fine, according to Burger King.  \u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 claims are false,\u201d a Burger King spokesperson said in a statement about the lawsuit. \u201cThe flame-grilled beef patties portrayed in our advertising are the same patties used in the millions of Whopper sandwiches we serve to guests nationwide.\u201d Arby\u2019s, McDonald\u2019s, and Taco Bell did not respond to requests for comment. Wendy\u2019s declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.  For Russo, that argument doesn\u2019t cut it. He\u2019s more concerned with what he calls the \u201ccommon-sense eyeball test.\u201d The fast food chains targeted in his suit, he said, are failing.  \u201cIf you look at what their advertisements are showing, and you look at what on a regular basis, every consumer is getting \u2026 [there\u2019s] a glaring disparity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could talk about weight \u2026 you could talk about volume, those are all the things the experts get into,\u201d he said. But if the image is drastically different from the product, he argues, those details don\u2019t matter.  In the Burger King case, a judge recently agreed to punt the question of what is \u201creasonable\u201d to a jury, refusing to dismiss the case in full as Burger King requested.  Starbucks will also have to face many of the claims brought against it in the class action.  \u201cPlaintiffs have adequately alleged that a significant portion of the general consuming public could be misled by the names of the at-issue beverages,\u201d a recent order states.  What you see is not what you get For Patten, a reasonable consumer is an \u201caverage consumer.\u201d The legal system, she said, often expect more from a reasonable consumer than she would from an average one. \u201cTrial courts tend to have a very high opinion of who the reasonable consumer is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think as a result of that, will dismiss a lot of these types of class actions, taking the position that the reasonable consumer of course knows that this type of advertising exaggerates the quality and quantity of food.\u201d  But Patten has heard from many complaining about this specific discrepancy, between how much food they expect due to advertising, and how much food they actually get.  \u201cWe get it for burgers, we\u2019ve gotten it for buckets of chicken, all sorts of different kinds of fast food,\u201d she said.   When it comes to allegations of false advertising, there are more egregious questions than whether a taco on the screen matches a taco in the hand. And Patten\u2019s not convinced that class actions are the way to go \u2014 if they\u2019re not dismissed, they often get settled, offering the defendant certain protections and giving consumers a small sum of cash, while their lawyers walk away with a larger bundle. But with people watching their budgets, it\u2019s worth examining whether customers are getting as much food as they expect from major fast food chains.  When people are \u201cusing their limited resources to purchase this, and then they\u2019re not being provided with the quantity of food they\u2019re expecting \u2014 that is an issue, no doubt.\u201d  The suits, and the attention they\u2019ve received, can help inform the public of what to really expect, Patten said.  They \u201ccan help educate consumers and make more savvy purchasers of their dinners,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best defense against deceptive marketing is an educated consumer.\u201d ", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T07:03:39Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230923024107-01-hangzhou-stadium-091923.jpg?c=original", "title": "12,000 athletes and a lotus-shaped mega stadium.

Here\u2019s what it looks like now", "content": "A rock formation in the Mississippi River normally only reachable by boat is accessible by foot for the second year in a row as water levels plummet.   Tower Rock juts out of the Mississippi River in Perry County, Missouri, south of St. Louis and around 25 miles north of Cape Girardeau. When water levels drop below 1.5 feet at a nearby river gauge, enough of the underlying ground is exposed for people to walk to the formation. Veronica Merrell visited Tower Rock this past weekend and shared photos on social media that showed several people made the trek out to the rock.  \u201cWe looked at the river gauges before we went and knew it was passable,\u201d Merrell told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up on the mighty Mississippi in a small town in Missouri and Tennessee, and to see it this low was pretty eye opening.\u201d  Water levels at the nearby gauge were near-zero earlier this week, with no significant improvement forecast in the near term as extreme drought grips the Central US. Every water level gauge along a nearly 400-mile stretch of the Mississippi from the Ohio River to Jackson, Mississippi, is at or below the low-water threshold, according data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and US Geological Survey.  Tower Rock was walkable last year amid another severe drought. But water levels this week were even below what they were in October 2022, USGS data shows. Before last October, the formation \u201cwas probably only accessible once or twice in the last decade,\u201d Steve Schell, a natural history biologist with the Missouri Department of Conservation, previously told CNN.

While there is no evidence to suggest that Russia, the US or China is preparing for an imminent nuclear test, the images, obtained and provided by a prominent analyst in military nonproliferation studies, illustrate recent expansions at three nuclear test sites compared with just a few years ago.  One is operated by China in the far western region of Xinjiang, one by Russia in an Arctic Ocean archipelago, and another in the US in the Nevada desert.  The satellite images from the past three to five years show new tunnels under mountains, new roads and storage facilities, as well as increased vehicle traffic coming in and out of the sites, said Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.  \u201cThere are really a lot of hints that we\u2019re seeing that suggest Russia, China and the United States might resume nuclear testing,\u201d he said, something none of those countries have done since underground nuclear testing was banned by the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. China and the US signed the treaty, but they haven\u2019t ratified it. Retired US Air Force Col. Cedric Leighton, a former intelligence analyst, reviewed the images of the three powers\u2019 nuclear sites and came to a similar conclusion. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that all three countries, Russia, China and the United States have invested a great deal of time, effort and money in not only modernizing their nuclear arsenals, but also in preparing the types of activities that would be required for a test,\u201d he said.  Moscow has ratified the treaty, but Russian President Vladimir Putin said in February he would order a test, if the US moves first, adding that \u201cno one should have dangerous illusions that global strategic parity can be destroyed.\u201d The expansions risk sparking a race to modernize nuclear weapons testing infrastructure at a time of deep mistrust between Washington and the two authoritarian governments, analysts said, though the idea of actual armed conflict is not considered imminent.  \u201cThe threat from nuclear testing is from the degree to which it accelerates the growing arms race between the United States on one hand, and Russia and China on the other,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe consequences of that are that we spend vast sums of money, even though we don\u2019t get any safer.\u201d Nuclear threats Lewis\u2019 comments came after a prominent nuclear watchdog group, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, earlier this year set its iconic Doomsday Clock, a measure of how close the world is to self-destruction, to 90 seconds to midnight, the clock\u2019s most precarious setting since its inception in 1947. The group cited the war in Ukraine, sparked by Russia\u2019s illegal invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, as main reason for its sobering assessment. \u201cRussia\u2019s thinly veiled threats to use nuclear weapons remind the world that escalation of the conflict \u2013 by accident, intention, or miscalculation \u2013 is a terrible risk. The possibility that the conflict could spin out of anyone\u2019s control remains high,\u201d the group said. In other words, the Doomsday Clock today signals a higher risk of the end of humankind than in 1953, when both the United States and the Soviet Union conducted dramatic above-ground tests of nuclear weapons.  Last month United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued a fresh appeal for key countries to ratify the international treaty that bans experiments for both peaceful and military purposes \u201cThis year, we face an alarming rise in global mistrust and division,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cAt a time in which nearly 13,000 nuclear weapons are stockpiled around the world \u2014 and countries are working to improve their accuracy, reach and destructive power \u2014 this is a recipe for annihilation.\u201d Lewis pointed out that the unexpectedly poor performance of the Russian military in Ukraine could be part of the impetus for Moscow to consider resuming nuclear tests. Dmitry Medvedev, a hawkish backer of Putin and the current deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s Security Council, has vowed Moscow \u201cwould have to use nuclear weapons\u201d if the Ukraine counteroffensive became successful. Medvedev\u2019s bellicose rhetoric has raised eyebrows, but Putin is Russia\u2019s key decision-maker, and widely seen as the real power behind the throne during Medvedev\u2019s four-year presidency.  Belarus, which has played a key role in Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has also received tactical nuclear weapons from Moscow, President Alexander Lukashenko said in August. He added that Minsk would be willing to use them in the face of foreign \u201caggression.\u201d Russia and China Even as the Russian military was invading Ukraine last year, analysts have also seen an expansion of the country\u2019s nuclear test site in Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean archipelago.  In mid-August, the facility received renewed focus when Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu paid a visit, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.  The Novaya Zemlya site was first used by the Soviet Union to conduct nuclear tests in 1955 until the USSR\u2019s final underground explosion in 1990. During that time, the site saw a total of 130 tests involving more than 200 devices, according to a review published in the Science and Global Security journal. Satellite images obtained by CNN showed that there has been extensive construction at the Novaya Zemlya test site from 2021 to 2023, with ships and new shipping containers arriving at its port, roads being kept clear in the winter, and tunnels dug deep into the Arctic mountains.  \u201cThe Russian test site is now open year round, we see them clearing snow off roads, we see them building new facilities.\u201d Lewis said.  Near those facilities are tunnels where Russia has tested in past, Lewis said. \u201cIn the past five or six years, we\u2019ve seen Russia dig new tunnels, which suggests that they are prepared to resume nuclear testing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear to me that the Russians are gearing up for a possible nuclear test,\u201d added Leighton, the former US Air Force intelligence officer and now a CNN analyst. But he offered what he said were important \u201ccaveats.\u201d \u201cThe Russians may be trying to go right up to the line by making all the preparations for a nuclear test, but not actually carrying one out. In essence, they\u2019d be doing this to \u2018scare\u2019 the West,\u201d Leighton said. Moscow has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on this subject, and there is no way know exactly what is going on hidden from the view of satellites. Increased activity was also detected at the Chinese nuclear test site in Lop Nur, a dried up salt lake between two deserts in the sparsely populated western China.  Satellite images show a new, fifth underground tunnel has been under excavation in recent years, and fresh roads have been built. A comparison of the images taken in 2022 and 2023 shows the spoil pile has been steadily increasing in size, leading analysts to believe tunnels are being expanded, Lewis said. In addition, the main administration and support area has seen new construction projects. A new storage area was built in 2021 and 2022, which could be used for storing explosives, he added. \u201cThe Chinese test site is different than the Russian test site,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe Chinese test site is vast, and there are many different parts of it.\u201d \u201c(It) looks really busy, and these things are easily seen in satellite imagery. If we can see them, I think the US government certainly can,\u201d he added. Increased activity at Lop Nur was also noted in an April report by the Sasakawa Peace Foundation\u2019s China Observer project, a group of China experts in Japan. After an analysis of satellite photos of the Lop Nur site, the group concluded that China\u2019s \u201cpossible goal is to conduct subcritical nuclear tests.\u201d It found a possible sixth testing tunnel under construction at Lop Nur, saying \u201cthe fact that a very long tunnel has been dug along the mountain\u2019s terrain with bends on the way indicates that the construction of the test site is in its final phase.\u201d In a statement to CNN, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry criticized the report as \u201chyping up \u2018China\u2019s nuclear threat\u2019,\u201d and described it as \u201cextremely irresponsible.\u201d \u201cSince the announcement of suspending nuclear tests in 1996, the Chinese side has consistently respected this promise and worked hard in defending the international consensus on prohibiting nuclear testing,\u201d it said. It added that the international world should have \u201chigh vigilance\u201d about the United States\u2019 activities in nuclear testing. Activity in Nevada\u2019s desert The US releases an unclassified version of the Nuclear Posture Review every few years, which provides an overview of the role of nuclear weapons in its security strategy. The most recent report, released in October last year, said that Washington would only consider using nuclear weapons in \u201cextreme circumstances.\u201d However, it also stated that the US does not adopt a \u201cno first use policy\u201d because it would result in an \u201cunacceptable level of risk\u201d to its security. The US conducted its last underground test in 1992, but Lewis said the US has long been keeping itself in a state of readiness for a nuclear test, ready to react if one of its rivals moves first.  \u201cThe United States has a policy of being prepared to conduct a nuclear test on relatively short notice, about six months,\u201d he said. The commercial satellite imagery, taken above the nuclear test site in Nevada, officially known as the Nevada National Security Site, shows that an underground facility \u2013 the U1a complex \u2013 was expanded greatly between 2018 and 2023.  The National Security Administration (NNSA), an arm of the US Department of Energy that oversees the site, says the laboratory is for conducting \u201csubcritical\u201d nuclear experiments, a longstanding practice meant to ensure the reliability of weapons in the current stockpile without full-scale testing. \u201cIn subcritical experiments, chemical high explosives generate high pressures, which are applied to nuclear weapon materials, such as plutonium. The configuration and quantities of explosives and nuclear materials are such that no nuclear explosion will occur,\u201d the NNSA\u2019s website says. In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment, a spokesperson from the NNSA confirmed it has been \u201crecapitalizing infrastructure and scientific capabilities\u201d at the Nevada test site, which includes procuring new advanced sources and detectors, developing reactivity measurement technology, and continuing tunneling activity. \u201c(This) will provide modern diagnostic capabilities and data to help maintain the safety and performance of the US nuclear stockpile without further underground nuclear explosive testing,\u201d the spokesman added. A report from the US Governmental Accountability Office (GAO) released in August says the US will build two measurement devices at the Nevada site to \u201cmake new measurements of plutonium during subcritical experiments.\u201d The devices and related infrastructure improvements, needed \u201cto inform plans for modernizing the nuclear weapons stockpile\u201d will cost about $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion and be ready by 2030, according to the GAO report. A spokesman from the National Security Council also told CNN that it is closely monitoring Russia\u2019s military activities, but added it has \u201cnot seen any reason to adjust our own nuclear posture.\u201d However, the expansion of facilities at the Nevada test site could fuel fears in Moscow and Beijing that Washington may be preparing for a nuclear test \u2013 because while both countries could see the development from satellite images, they lack the ability to independently verify what\u2019s going on inside, Lewis said.  And such perceptions can become dangerous, especially in the current era with fear and lack of trust on all sides, he said. \u201cThe danger is even if all three start by only planning to go second, one of them might talk themselves into the importance of going first, one of them might decide that since everybody else is doing it, it\u2019s better to get the jump and really get going.\u201d If they do, the world would know \u2013 any major underground blast is likely to be detected by the International Monitoring System (IMS), a network of 337 facilities that monitors the planet for signs of nuclear explosions. Continued modernization Hans Kristensen, the director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, agreed there is a real danger of testing escalation should one of the major powers do so.  \u201cThe minute one of the major nuclear powers pops a nuclear weapon somewhere, you know, all bets are off, because there\u2019s no doubt that everyone will join that business again,\u201d he said. In a recent yearbook on world nuclear forces, co-authored by Kristensen and published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in June, analysts concluded that all of the world\u2019s nuclear powers \u2013 which also included the United Kingdom, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel \u2013 have continued to \u201cmodernize their nuclear arsenals\u201d last year. Russia, for instance, announced on September 1 that its new Sarmat or \u201cSatan II\u201d intercontinental ballistic missile is operational. The Sarmat could carry 10 and possibly more independently targeted nuclear warheads with a range of up to 18,000 kilometers (or about 11,185 miles), according to the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.  The US is also building new delivery systems for nuclear warheads like the B-21 stealth bomber and Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine. As part of the upgrade, nuclear storage sites will also be added to US Air Force bases in Ellsworth and Dyess, Kristensen wrote in a report in the Federation of American Scientists in 2020. The SIPRI report said that Russia and the US currently possess about 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world, with the US estimated to have more than 3,700 warheads stockpiled, and Russia having about 4,500. Both countries keep their strategic nuclear arsenals on \u201chair-trigger\u201d alert, meaning that nuclear weapons can be launched on short notice. China\u2019s nuclear arsenal has increased from 350 warheads in January 2022 to 410 in January 2023. In the past, China did not marry up warheads with delivery systems, keeping their nuclear forces on a \u201clow-alert\u201d status. But the Arms Control Association (ACA) NGO said this year the PLA now rotates missile battalions from stand-by to ready-to-launch status monthly. Fiona Cunningham, a nonresident scholar in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote in the ACA\u2019s monthly journal in August that Beijing\u2019s nuclear stance is hard to discern. \u201cThe increasing size, accuracy, readiness, and diversity of China\u2019s arsenal bolsters the credibility of the country\u2019s ability to threaten retaliation for a nuclear strike and enables China to make more credible threats to use nuclear weapons first,\u201d she wrote. But Kristensen told CNN that while all three major powers have been engaging in subcritical tests, he believed \u201ca full-scale nuclear test is unlikely.\u201d  Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, agreed, writing in the organization\u2019s September newsletter that \u201cChina, Russia, and the United States continue to engage in weapons-related activities at their former nuclear testing sites.\u201d But Kimball noted that without a real test, \u201cit is more difficult, although not impossible, for states to develop, prove, and field new warhead designs.\u201d What\u2019s the point of more tests? But if all three countries have suspended nuclear testing since the 1990s, what could they gain from the resumption of these tests? Lewis said a reason to test, especially for China, is to get more up-to-date data for computer models that show what a nuclear explosion will do. Because while the United States and Russia have conducted hundreds of tests, China has only done around 40 and has significantly fewer data points. \u201cThose 40 tests were done in the 1960s, in the 1970s, in the 1980s, when their technology wasn\u2019t that high. The data that you have is not that good,\u201d Lewis said.   Others point out that the big powers have not tested low-yield nuclear weapons, which produce a smaller nuclear explosion that might be targeted on a specific battlefield unit or formation, rather than destroying a major city.  In a 2022 report for the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Baltimore, researchers Michael Frankel, James Scouras and George Ullrich suggest that the US might hesitate to retaliate for a Russian low-yield attack because it has not tested the types of weapons it would need to use. \u201cWhile the United States now has several lower-yield weapons in its arsenal, they are insufficient in quantity and diversity of delivery systems,\u201d their report, titled \u201cTickling the Sleeping Dragon\u2019s Tail,\u201d says. In particular, the report says, smaller nukes, with yields lower than a kiloton (for comparison, the atomic bomb the US dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945 had a yield of about 15 kilotons) that can be delivered by aircraft or ships have been proposed a deterrent to Russian nuclear threats. \u201cSuch weapons are unlikely to be available absent testing,\u201d the report says.  The United States, the world\u2019s first nuclear power, has conducted 1,032 tests, the first coming in 1945 and the last coming in 1992, according to the United Nations\u2019 data. The Soviet Union \u2013 now Russia \u2013 conducted 715 between 1949 and 1990, and China has tested 45 times between 1964 and 1996.  Lewis believed an urge for the US, Russia and China to be the first to develop \u201cexotic\u201d weapons of the future also instills a need for nuclear testing of those possible systemsl. Some of these may soon be in the Russian arsenal, as Putin has boasted about weapons like an nuclear-armed doomsday torpedo and a nuclear-powered cruise missile.  \u201cWe\u2019re on the verge of this kind of science fiction future where we are resurrecting all of these terrible ideas from the Cold War,\u201d Lewis said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T04:30:15Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230923005458-01-gaza-protests-092223-restricted.jpg?c=original", "title": "Israel strikes Gaza targets after incendiary balloons sent across border", "content": "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) carried out strikes on what it called Hamas targets in Gaza on Friday, after militants in the enclave launched incendiary balloons towards Israel for the first time in over a year.

Robert Mercer claimed to have terminal stage 4 colon cancer and convinced people to donate to his GoFundMe campaign to help pay to enter the Las Vegas competition. Now, the 37-year-old Vallejo resident tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal that it was all a lie.  \u201cI did lie about having colon cancer. I don\u2019t have colon cancer,\u201d Mercer told David Schoen of the Las Vegas Review-Journal. \u201cI used that to cover my situation. What I did was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have told people I have colon cancer.\u201d Mercer started the GoFundMe in June, according to the newspaper.  But a few months later, people in the poker community grew skeptical about Mercer\u2019s condition, according to Doug Parscal Jr., who donated to Mercer. \u201cIt was a mix of emotions because on one hand, I wanted him to be lying,\u201d Parscal Jr. told CNN. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want someone to be dying of that.\u201d The goal of the GoFundMe was to fulfill Mercer\u2019s dream of playing in the WSOP\u2019S $10,000 buy-in No-limit Hold\u2019em World Championship, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Mercer also received donations through private transactions, including a paid suite at the Bellagio hotel during the tournament. In all, he received between $30,000 to $50,000 worth of donations, according to the newspaper. He has no intention of paying anyone back, according the Review-Journal, because \u201che believes he has undiagnosed breast cancer and the donations were made because he was sick.\u201d CNN has reached out to Mercer for comment. A \u2018heinous\u2019 act Cody Daniels is also competing in the World Series of Poker competition, but he says he is legitimately battling a chronic illness. He is a 2015 Make-A-Wish recipient who used his wish to meet former President Barack Obama. He told CNN that hearing about Mercer\u2019s false diagnosis is \u201cheinous.\u201d \u201cWhen there was doubt about his Illness, I didn\u2019t know what to root for,\u201d Daniels told CNN. \u201cI said \u2018he\u2019s either lyin\u2019 or dyin.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve spent half of my life in the hospital, and to do what he did is insane,\u201d  Daniels said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a shame and one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Parscal Jr., meanwhile, says he lost his friend to colon cancer. That, he says, is why he was a big promoter of Mercer\u2019s fundraiser. While he calls the situation \u201ctwisted,\u201d he says it\u2019s bigger than the money.  \u201cWe spent a lot of time and emotions,\u201d Parscal Jr. said.  Many people in the poker community sent text messages and called Mercer to give him support while Mercer would cry on the phone, Parscal Jr. says.  \u201cIt was a really sick feeling in my stomach,\u201d Parscal Jr. said when he found out it was a hoax. The online fundraiser has been removed since Mercer\u2019s confession, says Jeff Platt, a GoFundMe spokesperson.  \u201cGoFundMe has zero tolerance for the misuse of our platform and takes swift action against those who exploit the generosity of our community,\u201d Platt told CNN in a statement. \u201cAll donors have been fully refunded, and Rob Mercer has been banned from using the platform for any future fundraisers.\u201d GoFundMe is also cooperating with law enforcement investigations, according to Platt.

Good luck if you\u2019re renting", "content": "In May, Viveca Chow hurriedly transferred $3,700 over her phone while standing in the lobby of a building in Queens, New York. She made the upfront payment to secure an apartment minutes after seeing it. It was a moment the 28-year-old lifestyle influencer \u2014 forced to leave her previous accommodation after the landlord increased her monthly rent by $1,000 \u2014 described to CNN as \u201cdystopian.\u201d  Yet it is something that Chow, along with millions of renters in big cities, has come to expect as part of the fight for affordable housing. Her realtor urged her to pay the holding deposit on the spot to secure the one-bedroom unit.  In many urban centers, an influx of workers and students after the pandemic has collided with a lack of accommodation for rent, high levels of inflation, and rising interest rates that are trapping some people in the rental market when they would otherwise be buying a home.  Average rents in New York and Sydney grew by an inflation-busting 4.7% and 6.9% respectively in the year to August, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. While growth in rental costs in both cities has slowed compared with its pandemic peaks, average rents are still at all-time highs.   In other places, rents are rising even faster. In London, the average annual rise in the cost of a rental property exceeded 17% in April and again last month, the biggest jumps since real estate agency Hamptons started collecting the data in 2014.  That runaway growth far exceeds both inflation and pay raises in the United Kingdom.  Many are struggling to meet the costs.  According to property website Realtor.com, affordability in the New York metropolitan area deteriorated the most out of the 50 largest US metro areas in the year to July. The share of median household income in the New York area eaten up by the median rent rose from 35% to 37% in that time.  Based on one approach, housing costs are judged affordable if they account for no more than 30% of the typical household income, Realtor.com said. This is also the benchmark used by the UK Office for National Statistics when assessing private rents.   \u2018Entirely unaffordable\u2019 In London, the destination for many UK college students looking for work after graduating, renting has become \u201centirely unaffordable\u201d for that cohort, said SpareRoom, the UK\u2019s biggest room search site, in a recent analysis.  The platform used the ONS\u2019s measure of affordability in its study and the average graduate starting salary of \u00a329,000 ($36,000) a year. According to SpareRoom\u2019s latest Quarterly Rental Index, average monthly room rent reached \u00a3971 ($1,190) in the second quarter, up by almost a fifth compared with the same period in 2022.  Barnaby Scudds is feeling the pain. The public relations executive moved to London in March after graduating last year and now pays \u00a3975 ($1,195) a month to rent a room, which gobbles up more than half of his monthly paycheck.    \u201cI\u2019m paid well for the work that I do, and yet it\u2019s still difficult,\u201d he told CNN.  Even at those prices, rooms get snapped up fast. \u201cIt is very difficult because properties come on at about six o\u2019clock in the morning generally, and they are normally gone by six o\u2019clock in the evening,\u201d he said.   Matt Hutchinson, communications director at SpareRoom, told CNN that the UK\u2019s chronic lack of supply of rental properties was to blame.  Beyond problems afflicting most global cities, such as a proliferation of short-term rentals offered through platforms like Airbnb, the shortage of places for long-term rent in London is exacerbated by local factors.  Since 2016, the UK government has increased taxes on purchases of second homes and cut the amount of tax landlords can claim back. Put simply, being a landlord in the UK isn\u2019t as lucrative as it used to be. \u201c[It] is a much more tight-margin experience than it was six, seven years ago. And a lot of people are just selling up and leaving the market,\u201d Hutchinson said, adding that rising interest rates, as well as higher costs for labor and materials, had discouraged many from investing in rental properties.  In a recent note about rental markets in 10 cities worldwide, Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, concluded: \u201cAffordability of housing is set to become the leading political issue within the next 12 months.\u201d  Rent caps \u2018a bad idea\u2019 London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, last month reiterated his call for rent control, urging the UK government to impose a two-year rent freeze for the capital\u2019s 2.7 million private tenants. It is a version of a policy proposed by politicians and campaigners over the years as a way out of the affordability crisis.  But rental caps, while instinctively appealing, are generally \u201ca bad idea,\u201d Nikodem Szumilo, director of the Bartlett Real Estate Institute at University College London, told CNN.   \u201cIt benefits people who live in the rent control unit and maybe the politicians who impose the policy, but nobody else,\u201d Szumilo said, noting that rental caps discouraged home builders from investing in new units, which in turn limited supply growth in places where demand might be rising.  A better way, Szumilo argues, is to simply make it easier to build more homes. Tokyo, the world\u2019s most populous city, housing more than 37 million people, has a \u201cvery deregulated market\u201d where rents are \u201crelatively stable,\u201d he said.   Policies that help people become homeowners \u2014 for example, offering subsidies on down payments or on mortgages for first-time buyers, as the UK government has done \u2014 are also effective, Szumilo said, because they help ease demand in the rental market.  Still, Chow in New York is grateful for rent control.  She and her partner live in one of the city\u2019s coveted rent-stabilized units, which means the $3,700 they pay each month can\u2019t increase by more than 3.75% if they renew the lease for another year. That\u2019s below the 4.7% annual increase in rental costs in the city recorded by Knight Frank at the start of August.  That \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s cheap,\u201d Chow said, but the cap provides a welcome safety net after the instabilities \u2014 and indignities \u2014 of her last place.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t even have a kitchen, a proper kitchen. It was like a kitchen nailed to the wall.

Jose Romero, 22, and Nathen Garley, 21, are facing several charges, including first-degree murder, in the killing of Froylan Villegas, according to the Albuquerque Police Department. Froylan had left a baseball game in Albuquerque on September 6 and was sitting in the front passenger seat as his cousin drove when \u201cat least 14 rounds\u201d were fired into their vehicle, a news release from the department states.  The boy died of his wounds. His cousin was critically injured and is still in the hospital, according to the department. Froylan\u2019s mother and infant brother were in the back seat of the truck but weren\u2019t hurt, though authorities say two rounds barely missed the infant who was in a car seat behind Froylan.   The tragic incident, which Chief Harold Medina on Thursday called a \u201ccase of mistaken identity,\u201d was one of several recent shootings that spurred Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to declare gun violence and drug abuse as a public health emergency. The governor\u2019s emergency order, which she issued September 8 \u2013 just two days after Froylan\u2019s killing \u2013 included a 30-day suspension of open and concealed carry laws in Albuquerque and Bernalillo County and temporarily banned the carrying of guns on public property with certain exceptions.  Less than a week later, a federal judge prevented enforcement of parts of the ban until a preliminary injunction hearing is held in the coming weeks, according to statements from Grisham\u2019s office and a gun rights advocacy group that filed a lawsuit over the ban, CNN previously reported.  Romero was arrested in Albuquerque on Thursday, Medina said during a news conference. Garley had been in custody since September 13, when he was arrested during a traffic stop by a New Mexico State Police trooper, who allegedly found nearly 100,000 fentanyl tablets while searching his car, State Police Chief Troy Weisler said at the news conference.     Weisler said authorities searched the phones of Garley and a female who was also in the vehicle at the time and discovered \u201cthey have been involved and had relations to individuals that were involved in the shooting.\u201d He said they alerted Albuquerque police \u201cso that we could bring this case to a close.\u201d  Weisler did not provide additional information about the female who was traveling with Garley but said a separate investigation into the drugs allegedly found in Garley\u2019s car is underway.

Bob Menendez and wife indicted on bribery charges; DOJ seizes gold bars and $500,000", "content": "New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was charged on Friday with corruption-related offenses for the second time in 10 years. Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, are accused of accepting \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes\u201d in exchange for the senator\u2019s influence, according to the newly unsealed federal indictment.  Prosecutors allege the bribes included gold, cash, home mortgage payments, compensation for a \u201clow-or-no-show job\u201d and a luxury vehicle. This is the second set of corruption charges levied against Menendez by the Justice Department in a decade. He previously fought off conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud related to alleged personal favors.  Menendez is up for reelection next year. He has been in the Senate since 2006. Senate Democratic Caucus rules will force Menendez to step aside as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he can still serve on the panel.  Menendez slammed the indictment in a statement. \u201cFor years, forces behind the scenes have repeatedly attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave. Since this investigation was leaked nearly a year ago, there has been an active smear campaign of anonymous sources and innuendos to create an air of impropriety where none exists,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe excesses of these prosecutors is apparent,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have misrepresented the normal work of a Congressional office. On top of that, not content with making false claims against me, they have attacked my wife for the longstanding friendships she had before she and I even met.\u201d Menendez also previously set up a legal defense fund. Beginning in April, his wife sold gold bars worth as much as $400,000, according to the senator\u2019s most recent financial disclosure form.  Accusations of corruption Menendez is charged with three alleged crimes, including being on the receiving end of a bribery conspiracy. The conspiracy counts also charge his wife Nadine, and three people described as New Jersey associates and businessmen, Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes.  A lawyer for Nadine Menendez said she denies any wrongdoing and would fight the federal indictment. Bob Menendez and the other defendants will appear in court at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. The group is accused of coordinating to use Menendez\u2019s power as a US senator to benefit them personally and to benefit Egypt. In the indictment, prosecutors accuse Menendez of trying to sway the president\u2019s choice of the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey to benefit one of the business associates and to pressure the Department of Agriculture to protect a business monopoly another contact had from Egypt. The Department of Agriculture in 2019 had contacted Egypt to object to it giving Menendez\u2019s contact, Hana, monopoly rights related to supplying halal meat to the US. Yet Hana met Menendez in his office along with others, including an Egyptian intelligence official, in May 2019, asking for help fending off the US agency\u2019s opposition. The group went to a Washington, DC, steakhouse for dinner that evening, the indictment said. Two days later, Menendez allegedly called an Agriculture Department official, asking them to stop opposing Hana\u2019s venture. \u201cWhen Official-1 attempted to explain why the monopoly was detrimental to U.S. interests, MENENDEZ reiterated his demand, in sum and substance, that the USDA stop interfering with IS EG Halal\u2019s monopoly. Official-1 did not accede to MENENDEZ\u2019s demand, but IS EG Halal nevertheless kept its monopoly,\u201d the indictment said. Searches turned up $500,000 in cash and more According to the indictment, searches of Menendez\u2019 home and safe deposit box that federal agents conducted in 2022 turned up nearly $500,000 in cash, including in envelopes inside jackets emblazoned with Menendez\u2019s name. Prosecutors say some of the envelopes had the fingerprints or DNA of one of the business contacts from whom the senator is accused of taking bribes. The federal investigators who searched Menendez\u2019s home also found a \u201cluxury vehicle paid for by [Jose] Uribe parked in the garage,\u201d as well as home furnishings from other business contacts and gold bars. Acquitted in previous trial  Menendez was charged by federal prosecutors from the US attorney\u2019s office in New Jersey in 2015 with conspiracy, bribery, and honest services fraud relating to allegedly abusing the power of his office. Prosecutors said the senator accepted more than $600,000 in political contributions, a luxurious hotel suite at the Park Hyatt in Paris, and free rides on a private jet from a wealthy ophthalmologist, Dr. Salomon Melgen, in exchange for political favors.   The corruption trial of Menendez ended in a mistrial in November 2017 after the jury reported it was deadlocked. Both men denied all of the charges. Following the mistrial, a federal judge acquitted them of several of the charges in 2018. The Justice Department dropped the remaining charges against Menendez. Melgen was convicted on dozens of counts of health care fraud and sentenced to 17 years in a separate case, but his sentence was commuted by then-President Donald Trump in 2021.  After his mistrial was announced in 2017, a defiant Menendez issued a warning at a news conference. \u201cTo those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat, I know who you are, and I won\u2019t forget you,\u201d he said at the time.

When asked about the comparison of Wilhelm to Nassar, his attorney told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s attention-seeking behavior and clearly designed to defame Dr. Wilhelm unfairly, rather than focusing on litigating the actual facts in a court of law.\u201d  When asked for comment about the lawsuit, a spokesperson from the USA Bobsled and Skeleton Federation told CNN: \u201cWhile we are unable to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit or any ongoing investigations, USABS condemns sexual misconduct.

According to the complaint, the organizations direct a patient to take high doses of progesterone within 72 hours of taking mifepristone to \u201creverse\u201d the effects of mifepristone.  HBI operates more than 2,000 \u201cpregnancy resource centers\u201d in the United States. RealOptions operates five clinics in California under the name RealOptions Obria Medical Clinics.

Murphy would appoint a senator to replace Menendez should he resign. Menendez is up for reelection in 2024.  Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, are accused of accepting \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes,\u201d including gold, cash and a luxury vehicle in exchange for the senator\u2019s influence.

Members of New Jersey\u2019s delegation in Washington, DC, also called on Menendez to step down. Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who some say could replace the senator, said the best thing for the state would be if he resigned. \u201cThese are serious allegations against Senator Menendez and if proven true, there is no room for this kind of conduct in public service,\u201d she said. Democratic Rep. Andy Kim also called for the senator to resign, saying the matter is too distracting for him to serve the state.  \u201cThe people of New Jersey absolutely need to know the truth of what happened, and I hope the judicial system works thoroughly and quickly to bring this truth to light,\u201d Kim said in a statement. \u201cIn the meantime, I don\u2019t have confidence that the Senator has the ability to properly focus on our state and its people while addressing such a significant legal matter. He should step down.\u201d Menendez has faced federal charges and seen political allies come out against him before. In 2015, he was charged with conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud relating to allegedly abusing the power of his office as part of a relationship with a wealthy ophthalmologist. The case ended with a mistrial, and the senator was then acquitted of several charges. The Justice Department declined to retry the case.  After the mistrial was announced in 2017, Menendez had a stark warning for fellow Garden State politicians.  \u201cTo those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat, I know who you are, and I won\u2019t forget you,\u201d he said at the time.

Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle are hoping to pass a short-term funding extension to keep the lights on and avert a shutdown. But it\u2019s not at all clear that plan will succeed amid deep divisions over spending between the two parties and policy disagreements over issues such as aid to Ukraine.   Here\u2019s what to know if the government shuts down and what\u2019s driving the current state of play:  How a government shutdown could be triggered   Government funding expires at the end of the day on Saturday, September 30 when the clock strikes midnight and it becomes October 1, which marks the start of the new fiscal year. (As shorthand, the deadline is commonly described as September 30 at midnight.)   If Congress fails to pass legislation to renew funding by that deadline, then the federal government will shut down at midnight. Since that would take place over the weekend, the full effects of a shutdown wouldn\u2019t be seen until the start of the work week on Monday.   What could happen during a shutdown  In the event of a shutdown, many government operations would come to a halt, but some services deemed \u201cessential\u201d would continue.   Federal agencies have contingency plans that serve as a roadmap for what will continue and what will stop. The White House Office of Management and Budget will formally initiate the process of preparing for a shutdown on Friday, sending  a communication to agencies reminding them to review and update shutdown plans.  Government operations and services that continue during a shutdown are activities deemed necessary to protect public safety and national security or considered critical for other reasons. Examples of services that have continued during past shutdowns include border protection, federal law enforcement and air traffic control.   Federal employees whose work is deemed \u201cnon-essential\u201d would be put on furlough, which means that they would not work and would not receive pay during the shutdown. Employees whose jobs are deemed \u201cessential\u201d would continue to work, but they too would not be paid during the shutdown.  Once a shutdown is over, federal employees who were required to work and those who were furloughed will receive backpay.   In the past, backpay for furloughed employees was not guaranteed, though Congress could and did act to ensure those workers were compensated for lost wages once a shutdown ended. Now, however, backpay for furloughed workers is automatically guaranteed as a result of legislation led by Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, that was enacted in 2019. Employees deemed \u201cessential\u201d and required to work were already guaranteed backpay after a shutdown prior to the passage of that legislation.    And federal employees aren\u2019t the only ones who can feel the effects of a shutdown.  During past shutdowns, national parks have become a major focal point of attention. Although National Park Service sites across the country have been closed during previous government shutdowns, many remained open but severely understaffed under the Trump administration during a shutdown in 2019. Some park sites operated for weeks without park service-provided visitor services such as restrooms, trash collection, facilities or road maintenance. \u201cIf you\u2019re a government worker, it\u2019s highly disruptive \u2013 whether you\u2019re not going to work or whether you are,\u201d said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization. \u201cIf you\u2019re somebody who wants to use one of the services that you can\u2019t get access to \u2026 it\u2019s highly disruptive. But for many people \u2026 all the things that they are expecting and used to seeing of government are still happening and the inconveniences and the kind of wasted time and wasted resources aren\u2019t things that they see and feel directly.\u201d   Why the US could be headed for a shutdown   There is a deep divide between the House and Senate right now over the effort to reach consensus on and pass full-year spending legislation as House conservative hardliners push for deep spending cuts and controversial policy add-ons that Democrats as well as some Republicans have rejected as too extreme.   With the funding deadline looming, top lawmakers from both parties hope to pass a short-term funding extension known on Capitol Hill as a continuing resolution or CR for short. These short-term measures are frequently used as a stopgap solution to avert a shutdown and buy more time to try to reach a broader full-year funding deal.   It\u2019s not clear, however, whether there will be enough consensus to pass even a short-term funding bill out of both chambers before the end of the month as House conservatives rail against the possibility of a stopgap bill and have threatened to vote against one while demanding major policy concessions that have no chance of passing the Senate.   A fight over aid to Ukraine could also take center stage and further complicate efforts to pass a short-term bill. Senate Democrats and Republicans strongly support additional aid to Ukraine, which could be included as part of a stopgap bill, but many House Republicans are reluctant to continue sending aid and do not want to see that attached to a short-term funding bill.   What has the White House said about a shutdown? The White House issued a stark warning this week that a shutdown could threaten crucial federal programs. In its warning, the White House estimated 10,000 children would lose access to Head Start programs across the country as the Department of Health and Human Services is prevented from awarding grants during a shutdown, while air traffic controllers and TSA officers would have to work without pay, threatening travel delays across the country. A shutdown would also delay food safety inspections under the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cThese consequences are real and avoidable \u2013 but only if House Republicans stop playing political games with peoples\u2019 lives and catering to the ideological demands of their most extreme, far-right members,\u201d the White House said.

The storm, packing maximum sustained winds of 70 mph with higher gusts, is expected to affect areas hundreds of miles beyond its center with several inches of rain as it treks up the coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. A hurricane watch was issued for portions of eastern North Carolina, where water levels were rising along parts of the coast Friday night. Ophelia moved north-northwest toward the East Coast on Friday at 12 mph. The storm\u2019s center is forecast to approach North Carolina\u2019s coast Friday night, the National Hurricane Center stated in an update. \u201cSome additional strengthening cannot be ruled out as Ophelia traverses the warm waters of the Gulf Stream on its approach to eastern North Carolina. While this does not seem like the most likely outcome and is not explicitly forecast, the increased risk warrants the issuance of a Hurricane Watch for a portion of the North Carolina coast,\u201d the hurricane center said. Coastal areas will bear the brunt of the heaviest rains and wind, though inland residents will get storms, too. Ophelia is targeting a landfall in North Carolina Saturday, but by the time the storm\u2019s journey is done, wind and rain will have reached as far north as southern New England.  TRACK THE STORM Ophelia\u2019s strong winds could knock out power in some places, especially along the coast. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper ordered a state of emergency for the entire state Friday as the storm was already lashing coastal areas. The order will help make it easier for emergency crews to respond to the storm. The heavy rain and wind affecting North Carolina and Virginia will worsen into the evening Friday and affect more areas as the storm approaches the coast, so tropical storm warnings stretch from just south of Charleston, South Carolina, to around the Maryland-Delaware state line. Storm surge watches and warnings stretch from Surf City, North Carolina, to the Chesapeake Bay.  A few tornadoes are also possible in parts of the coastal mid-Atlantic.   The greatest risk of heavy rain and flooding Friday into Saturday was expected in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia, where 3 to 5 inches are forecast. Areas where strong bands of thunderstorms develop could see as much as 7 inches of rain.  A broad stretch of the mid-Atlantic into southern New England could see 2 to 4 inches of rainfall from late Friday through the weekend.  Areas along the coast could also see hazardous storm surge and coastal flooding, strong rip currents and rough surf. One to 5 feet of surge is possible in some areas, particularly in inlets and rivers from around Surf City, North Carolina, to Manasquan Inlet on the New Jersey shore.  The highest risk of storm surge flooding will coincide with Saturday high tides, particularly in a coastal area from New Jersey to the Virginia Tidewater.  More than two dozen flood gauges across the area were forecast to hit moderate or major flood levels Saturday, which means homes and businesses closest to the coast could flood and roads could become impassable.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T10:21:30Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230919011830-02-hfr-philippines-coral-reef-south-china-sea-intl-hnk.jpg?c=original", "title": "The Philippines accuses China\u2019s shadowy maritime militia of destroying coral reefs in South China Sea", "content": "Vibrant reefs filled with colorful fish and seaweed just two years ago have been turned into a wasteland of crushed corals in the South China Sea and the Philippines says it has identified a culprit \u2013 China\u2019s shadowy maritime militia. China has rejected the accusation, setting up another public disagreement with its neighbor over the flashpoint waterway. Videos released Monday by the Philippine Coast Guard showed a vast patch of bleached corals along the Rozul (Iroquios) Reef and Sabina (Escoda) Shoal in the South China Sea, which are underwater features within the country\u2019s internationally recognized exclusive economic zone (EEZ).   Both reefs are near Palawan, the Philippines\u2019 southwestern island chain fronting the South China Sea, but Beijing claims most of the large and strategic waterway as its own territory despite competing claims by neighbors and in defiance of an international ruling. Commodore Jay Tarriela, the coast guard spokesman, said divers had carried out \u201cunderwater surveys\u201d of the seabed and described \u201cvisible discoloration\u201d that indicated \u201cdeliberate activities\u201d meant to modify the natural topography of the terrain. \u201cThe continued swarming for the indiscriminate illegal and destructive fishing activities of the Chinese Maritime Militia in Rozul Reef and Escoda Shoal may have directly caused the degradation and destruction of the marine environment in the [West Philippine Sea] features,\u201d Tarriela said in a statement, referring to Manila\u2019s name for parts of the South China Sea within its jurisdiction.    Tarriela said between August 9 and September 11, the coast guard monitored 33 Chinese vessels within the vicinity of Rozul Reef and around 15 Chinese ships near Escoda Shoal. \u201cThe presence of crushed corals strongly suggests a potential act of dumping, possibly involving the same dead corals that were previously processed and cleaned before being returned to the seabed,\u201d Tarriela added.  The Philippine military last Saturday also accused China\u2019s maritime militia of massive destruction in the area. Chinese authorities did not comment publicly on the accusations until Thursday when the foreign ministry was asked at a regular daily briefing about the destruction of the corals.  \u201cThe relevant allegations of the Philippine side are false and groundless,\u201d spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters. \u201cWe advise the Philippine authorities not to utilize fabricated information to stage a political farce.\u201d Beijing claims \u201cindisputable sovereignty\u201d over almost all of the 1.3 million square miles of the South China Sea, as well as most of the islands and sandbars within it, including many features that are hundreds of miles away from China\u2019s mainland. That includes the Spratlys, an archipelago consisting of 100 small islands and reefs also claimed in full or part by the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Over the last two decades China has occupied a number of reefs and atolls across the South China Sea, building up military installations, including runways and ports, which have not only challenged the Philippines\u2019 sovereignty and fishing rights but also endanger the marine biodiversity in the highly contested resource-rich waterway.  Some of the atolls and islands that were built on saw sustained land reclamation take place, often with reefs being destroyed first and then built on.     In 2016, an international tribunal in The Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines in a landmark maritime dispute, which concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to the bulk of the South China Sea.  But Beijing has ignored the decision and continues to expand its presence in the waterway. \u2018A wake-up call\u2019 The recent Philippine coastguard footage of broken and bleached coral is in stark contrast to just two years ago.  The University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute said in a statement to CNN it had surveyed a portion of the Rozul (Iroquios) Reef in 2021 through an expedition funded by the country\u2019s National Security Council on board M/Y Panata. Videos and photos taken by the institute in 2021 showed the Rozul (Iroquios) Reef specked with red and purple colored corals with aquatic algae and moss lining the reef. \u201cAt that time, we found that the surveyed area had a reef ecosystem, with corals, benthic animals, fishes, seaweeds, and other marine organisms,\u201d it said, but stopped short on commenting on the current status of the reef since the latest information from the Philippine army and coast guard were \u201cbeyond the purview\u201d of the institute. \u201cThat said, we are open to working with other agencies to validate and analyze the impacts of recent activities in the area. Situations like this emphasize the need for continuous monitoring and support for more Marine Scientific Research activities by Filipino scientists especially in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d it added.    Signs of the marine degradation underscored the threats of coral harvesting in the territory, prompting several Filipino senators to raise suspicion over whether China has plans to militarize the atolls through reclamation, CNN affiliate CNN Philippines reported.  \u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call,\u201d said Gerry Arances, executive director of the Center for Energy, Ecology and Development (CEED). The images have exposed the marine impacts of China\u2019s construction of island facilities in the waters, frequent militia vessel patrols and expansive commercial fishing, Arances said. \u201cIt surfaces a lot of weaknesses, in terms of monitoring, regulating, and overall protecting marine biodiversity,\u201d he said. Western marine security experts, along with officials from the Philippines and the United States, have increasingly accused Beijing of using ostensibly civilian fishing vessels as a maritime militia that acts as an unofficial \u2013 and officially deniable \u2013 force that China uses to push its territorial claims both in the South China Sea and beyond. Dubbed Beijing\u2019s \u201clittle blue men\u201d, Chinese fishing vessels have also been involved in clashes with fishing vessels from Indonesia and Vietnam in contested waters.  Last month, the Philippines said a clash between Chinese coastguard and Philippine vessels included at least two blue-hulled vessels that looked like fishing vessels.  \u201cThere has been a collective failure internationally to respond to China\u2019s actions in the South China Sea, with regard to its militarizing the reefs and the shoals where China has, over a period of time, taken pristine marine features and turned them into concrete military bases and the collective response of much of the environmental advocacy groups has been silenced,\u201d said Ray Powell, director of SeaLight at the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation at Stanford University. The Philippines\u2019 growing calls for transparency on China\u2019s maneuvers in the disputed waters have enabled the country to garner international support from its allies to affirm its territorial sovereignty, Powell added.     At least two foreign ambassadors in Manila have expressed alarm over reports of destruction of marine resources in the South China Sea. United States Ambassador to the Philippines MaryKay Carlson described the reports on coral destruction around the reefs as \u201ctroubling,\u201d according to a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cHabitat damage harms ecosystems and negatively affects lives and livelihoods. We are working with our #FriendsPartnersAllies to protect [the Philippines\u2019] natural resources,\u201d she said on Monday. Japanese Ambassador Kazuhiko Koshikawa  also described the development as \u201cvery alarming news,\u201d as he urged everyone to protect \u201cthese vital ecosystems.\u201d The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the country has \u201cconsistently raised the alarm over ecologically harmful activities, conducted by foreign vessels\u201d in its maritime zones. Former president Rodrigo Duterte had attempted to forge closer ties with Beijing and made plans to cooperate on oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea, a move which divided Filipinos over the legitimacy of enabling China\u2019s ambitions in the disputed territory.    According to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, the Philippines occupies nine features in the Spratly chain while China occupies seven. But Beijing, which calls the island chain the Nansha Islands, has built up and fortified much of its claims in the chain, including building military bases on places like Subi Reef, Johnson Reef, Mischief Reef and Fiery Cross Reef. By contrast, only one of the Philippine-controlled features even has a runway, namely Thitu Reef. In 1999, the Philippines intentionally grounded a navy transport ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, on Second Thomas Shoal, manned by Filipino marines, to enforce the country\u2019s claim to the area. At Thursday\u2019s press briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson also referenced the Sierra Madre. \u201cIf the Philippine side is really concerned about the ecological environment of the South China Sea, it should tow away the warships illegally sitting on the Ren\u2019ai Reef as soon as possible and stop discharging sewage into the sea, and also to prevent irreversible damage to the sea caused by the warships that continue to rust,\u201d she said, using the Chinese name for the reef. Under current President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the country\u2019s National Security Team began to publicize its findings about what was actually happening in the West Philippine Sea and the South China Sea more regularly, Powell said.  \u201cThe Philippine government\u2019s transparency policy really earned it a lot of domestic support to push back and international support for its position,\u201d he said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T00:06:47Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230830113532-01-glenn-sulmasy.jpg?c=original", "title": "Coast Guard Academy banned a retired captain from its grounds after CNN reported he sexted a student. Now more allegations are surfacing.", "content": "The US Coast Guard Academy on Friday announced it had banned a retired captain from its grounds following a CNN report this week that revealed the captain, who is now president of a small college, exchanged hundreds of sexually suggestive messages with a student more than a decade ago.   Coast Guard attorneys had recommended prosecuting Glenn Sulmasy, who previously served as a department chair at the academy, on charges of conduct unbecoming an officer and willful dereliction of duty in 2016, even though he had retired eight months earlier. Coast Guard leaders rejected that recommendation and Sulmasy went on to have a successful career in academia, first as a provost at Bryant University in Rhode Island, and more recently as president of Nichols College in Massachusetts.  Also Friday, CNN obtained new documentation showing that Sulmasy\u2019s alleged misconduct was more sweeping and involved another former student and subordinates, prompting Coast Guard officials to seek to demote his rank after he retired.  The case against Sulmasy was another example of the Coast Guard internally expressing concern about alleged sexual misconduct but ultimately choosing not to hold its service members accountable. Earlier this year, CNN reported on a secret investigation\u2013dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor\u2013that found dozens of sexual assaults and rapes at the Coast Guard Academy had been mishandled, and in some cases covered up.   Following CNN\u2019s report on Sulmasy this week, the president of Bryant University released a statement that said Coast Guard officials contacted the president of the school in 2016 to revoke their prior recommendation of Sulmasy after completing an internal investigation. By then, Sulmasy had been hired and the then-president of Bryant University placed Sulmasy on probation. The statement did not say how long Sulmasy was on probation, nor whether the school had alerted Nichols College about the Coast Guard\u2019s concerns.   A spokesperson for Bryant University did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. The chairman of the board of trustees at Nichols College said in a note to the campus last week, after inquiries from CNN, the school had launched a third-party investigation into the matter and that Sulmasy volunteered to take a leave of absence pending the results of that investigation.  An attorney for Sulmasy did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.  CNN\u2019s report this week revealed a Coast Guard prosecution memo from 2016, which detailed texts Sulmasy exchanged with a student in 2010 and 2011. A Coast Guard attorney wrote in the memo that Sulmasy \u201coffered to give high grades and show favoritism in class in exchange for sexual banter.\u201d Separately, Melissa McCafferty, a 2011 academy graduate, told CNN that Sulmasy verbally harassed her and texted her that he would only write her a recommendation letter for law school if she sent him pictures of herself.   Sulmasy\u2019s attorney, Jeffrey Robbins, previously called McCafferty\u2019s allegations \u201cfalse\u201d and said the prosecution memo was \u201cridiculous on its face.\u201d Robbins also said that \u201cthe intimate texts in question\u201d with the student were characterized by prosecutors as \u201cconsensual in nature\u201d and added that the proposed prosecution had been \u201crightfully rejected by the adults within the legal wing of the Coast Guard.\u201d   After publication of that story, CNN obtained a 2016 Coast Guard performance evaluation of Sulmasy that documented other misconduct allegations against him. In addition to sexual texts Sulmasy exchanged with a cadet in 2010 and 2011, he engaged in \u201cflirtatious\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d communications with another former cadet in 2013 and made \u201csexist\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments to subordinates, according to the report, which concluded he committed an \u201cabuse of positional power.\u201d  \u201cThere is no abuse a military officer, a trustee of the public confidence, can commit that is more foul than use of the officer\u2019s rank, position, and prestige for self-gratification at the expense of others,\u201d the evaluation report stated.  The \u201ctoxic environment\u201d created by Sulmasy \u201cviolated the Coast Guard\u2019s sexual harassment and civil rights policies,\u201d stated the report, which recommended his rank be reduced. In a written response to the report, Sulmasy protested the recommended rank reduction and argued that the evaluation report should not be submitted because he had already retired. He also argued that his rank upon retirement could not be changed under US law and Coast Guard practice.  Coast Guard officials did not respond to requests for comment Friday. Earlier, however, an administrator with the Coast Guard Academy, Eva Van Camp, wrote in an email to the academy that allegations about Sulmasy had been referred to the Coast Guard Investigative Service and that he \u201cwill not be allowed aboard the Coast Guard Academy campus.\u201d  \u201cThe United States Coast Guard holds every one of us to the highest personal and professional standards and does not tolerate abuse in any form,\u201d Van Camp\u2019s email stated.

The ethics comments are the most specific to date from a sitting justice after an array of stories in recent months alleging that some members of the court are skirting ethics standards, and as Senate Democrats are pushing legislation that would require the high court to adopt a binding code of conduct.  They came as part of wide-ranging remarks that Kagan delivered at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana \u2013 where she also explained her side of a dispute of sorts with Chief Justice John Roberts after the majority of the court invalidated President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program last term. Kagan\u2019s speech came just hours after ProPublica published another story raising questions about Justice Clarence Thomas, this time over his attendance at a 2018 private dinner during a donor summit hosted by the Koch network, the political organization founded by libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch. Staffers told the outlet that the justice was brought in with the hope that such access would \u201cencourage donors to continue giving.\u201d  Earlier in the summer, Justice Brett Kavanaugh also said he hoped the court would soon take \u201cconcrete steps\u201d on ethics reform. And Kagan noted that Roberts gave a speech last spring in which he said the Supreme Court had to be held to the highest standards of conduct.  \u201cThat has to be right,\u201d she said Friday. The lower courts, Kagan explained, already have an extensive code of ethics in place, but the justices comply with only some aspects voluntarily. She said there is a \u201clegitimate concern\u201d that the Supreme Court is unusual in certain respects and that some of the rules that apply to the lower courts \u201cdo not fit quite as well\u201d at the high court\u2019s level.  \u201cBut, of course, what we could do is just adapt the code of conduct that the other court systems have in order to reflect\u201d certain differences, Kagan said, adding: \u201cAnd I think it would be a good thing for the court to do that.\u201d \u201cIt would help in our own compliance with the rules and it would \u2013 I think \u2013 go far in persuading other people that we were adhering to the highest standards of conduct,\u201d she said.  Asked whether she would reveal \u201cwho is the holdup\u201d on the high court, Kagan laughed.  \u201cNo, no,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat goes on in the conference room goes on in the conference room.\u201d  Kagan also said she didn\u2019t want to suggest there was just one holdout. \u201cThere are complicated issues here,\u201d she said, adding that there are good-faith disagreements and concerns.  \u201cThere are some things to be worked out, and I hope we can get them worked out,\u201d she said.  On Roberts and dissents Kagan was also asked by the moderator, Notre Dame Law School Dean G. Marcus Cole, about an unusual exchange she had with Roberts last term over Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan.  Writing for a 6-3 majority, Roberts struck down the program, triggering a fiery dissent from Kagan. Kagan, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that \u201cin every respect, the Court today exceeds its proper limited role in our Nation\u2019s governance.\u201d At the very end of his majority opinion, Roberts briefly digressed from the case at hand and appeared to address the dissent, noting that it had become a \u201cdisturbing feature of some recent opinions to criticize the decisions with which they disagree as going beyond the proper role of government.\u201d  Noting her disagreement, Roberts took the occasion to write, \u201cWe do not mistake this plainly heartfelt disagreement for disparagement.\u201d On Friday, Cole asked Kagan for her thoughts upon reading Roberts\u2019 words.  Kagan joked at first, saying it would be difficult to provide a full answer without the chief in attendance. But then she said she disagreed with part of Roberts\u2019 sentiment but agreed with another.  She said that she didn\u2019t think it was \u201cdisturbing at all\u201d for dissenters to speak out when they believe the majority has gone beyond its proper role. It would be disturbing, she said, if the dissent pulled its punches.  But she acknowledged that her dissent had been strong, and she agreed with the chief that it should not be taken personally.  \u201cI admire the chief justice enormously,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cI admire him as a person, as a judge. \u201cI admire him as the institutional leader of the court,\u201d she added Divisions on the court do not always fall along particular ideological lines, she said Friday, suggesting that commentator previously overreacted in a case about copyright infringement concerning the late Andy Warhol\u2019s art.  She noted that she and liberal Justice Sotomayor fell on opposite sides in the dispute and that their opinions highlighted their sharp disagreements.  The reaction, she suggested, was akin to \u201cOoh, let\u2019s watch them catfight or something like that.\u201d On precedent Kagan reiterated her complaint that the conservative majority is moving too quickly to overturn precedent, although she did not go into depth about any particular case.  \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we won\u2019t have that year after year, case after case,\u201d she said. \u201cAdherence to precedent is important because it prevents the court from looking like a political actor. \u201cPeople have no right to expect that they are going to agree with all the decisions that courts make,\u201d she said. \u201cBut people do want courts \u2013 and have a right to expect that courts act like courts \u2013 and that (they) don\u2019t look like other political actors.\u201d Concerning the overruling of precedent when new justices arrive, she said: \u201cWhen the court kind of goes back and forth, it makes people think that courts are just sort of making it up on the fly, and that\u2019s an extremely damaging thing for the judicial system and I think for our country.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T23:23:08Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922101353-04-menendez-indictment-photos.jpg?c=original", "title": "Sen.

Bob Menendez, allegedly accepted gold bar bribes, prosecutors allege, according to a newly unsealed federal indictment. Wait, you can own gold bars? Yes. It\u2019s actually a booming trend. (Spokespeople for Menendez didn\u2019t respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Separately, he released a statement on Friday calling the indictment part of \u201can active smear campaign.\u201d) Bank failures this year led to a surge in demand for gold bars and coins Demand for gold was already on the rise as people sought ways to hedge their investments against inflation. Since gold is a tangible asset with a limited supply, it offers that stability. Then, a string of bank failures, beginning with the demise of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year, added to the momentum.  It was \u201ca wakeup call\u201d to many people, said Jonathan Rose, CEO of Genesis Gold Group, a precious metals firm in Beverly Hills, California. \u201cThere was a feeling of helplessness,\u201d which he said he could attest to since he had money deposited at Western Alliance, which came under a significant amount of stress in the wake of SVB\u2019s collapse.  \u201cA lot of people were fearful thinking, \u2018Maybe my money is not as safe as I thought it was in the banking system.\u2019\u201d As a result, interest in owning gold jumped as people searched for tangible stores of value that \u201ccan\u2019t evaporate,\u201d Rose told CNN.  The value of a kilogram of gold hit a one-year-record high of nearly $66,000 in May, according to data Goldprice.org.  Data from the World Gold Council supports what Rose witnessed.  Demand for gold bars and coins in the US hit a 13-year high in the second quarter, according to an August report the Council published.  \u201cThe after-effects of the banking crisis supported demand early in the quarter, as did the tense US debt ceiling negotiations,\u201d the report states. (In the spring, the US government came very close to defaulting on its debt for the first time in the nation\u2019s history. Ultimately, default was avoided in an 11th-hour deal, but it caused Fitch Ratings to downgrade US debt two months later.) Demand has since slowed down, but it will \u201clikely pick up again should any signs of banking instability reemerge and on approach to the 2024 presidential election campaigns,\u201d according to the report. If you can invest in gold, why do people want to physically own it? Even though you can invest in gold and other precious metals without physically owning them, people tend to prefer \u201chaving the currency in their hands,\u201d said Rose. That\u2019s because if, for instance, you invest in a gold ETF, \u201cit\u2019s still tied to the market,\u201d he said. That means if the market were to plunge, you\u2019d be exposed to it and suffer some losses as a result.   Where should people keep their gold?  Plenty of his clients have buried the gold he\u2019s sold them in the ground, he said. One even stored it in an empty paint can in their garage. Other people who prefer to keep gold under their own roof store it in a gun safe or floor safe, he added.   For added assurance, you can take out an insurance policy or keep it in a safe deposit box at a bank, but most of his clients opt not to, he said.  However, people who want to invest in IRS-approved physical gold in their tax-deferred investment accounts by law are required to keep it in a bank or with a non-bank trustee.

Staffers told the outlet that the justice was brought in with the hope that \u201csuch access would encourage donors to continue giving.\u201d The report, the latest in a series by ProPublica that has revealed close relationships between Thomas and conservative interests, is likely to again stir questions about Thomas\u2019 ethics, especially given the Koch network\u2019s occasional support for litigation before the Supreme Court. Thomas arrived for the 2018 dinner on a Gulfstream G200 jet, although a Koch network spokesperson told the outlet that the network did not pay for the private jet and it was not disclosed on his financial disclosure forms for that year. A spokesperson for the Koch network told ProPublica that Thomas wasn\u2019t present for fundraising conversations. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson said, \u201cThe idea that attending a couple events to promote a book or give dinner remarks, as all the justices do, could somehow be undue influence just doesn\u2019t hold water.\u201d Thomas did not respond to a request for comment to ProPublica. CNN has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment. The story will raise new questions that have been dogging the Supreme Court for months as critics, including Democrats in Congress, argue that justices need a code of conduct that specifically applies to the high court. The justices voluntarily follow ethics regulations written for lower court judges. In addition, it comes as the justices are poised to hear a major case this term, Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc. v. Raimondo, brought by a group of fishermen with counsel being provided by a Koch-affiliated organization. The case could significantly scale back on the power of federal agencies and impact everything from how the government addresses issues such as climate change, public health and immigration. Conservatives have long sought to rein in regulatory authority, arguing that Washington has too much control over American businesses and individual lives. The court has agreed to directly consider whether it should overturn a 1984 case called Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. A spokesperson for a Koch-affiliated group told ProPublica that Loper is a \u201ccase seeking to restore one of the core tenets of our democracy: that Congress, not the administrative agency, makes the laws.\u201d Critics, however, say Koch-funded groups have long targeted the Supreme Court precedent that is at stake in the case. \u201cThe newest investigation of ProPublica sheds new light on Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 deep and long ties to billionaires Charles Koch and Harlan Crow and how he parlayed his public office into a vehicle for luxury travel and access to clubs few can afford,\u201d said Lisa Graves, who leads the progressive watchdog group True North Research. \u201cBut more than that, we know that his benefactors are funding an extreme agenda to remake our laws to suit their interests, including Koch\u2019s long-standing antipathy for Chevron deference to agency expertise, a nearly 40-year-old legal precedent the Supreme Court is considering reversing and destroying,\u201d she said. ProPublica has previously reported luxury travel bankrolled by wealthy friends that often went unreported on the justice\u2019s financial disclosure forms.

The court documents indicate that the Justice Department has filed money laundering charges against former Filipino election administrator Andres Bautista \u2013 and that four executives from Smartmatic subsidiaries are implicated as uncharged co-conspirators.  The bribery claims are sure to reverberate in Smartmatic\u2019s ongoing defamation cases. Trump allies repeatedly peddled the lie that the company manipulated the results in 2020, despite the fact that its machines were only used in one California county that year.  Smartmatic spokeswoman Samira Saba said in a statement that the Florida-based company \u201chas never won a project through any illegal means\u201d and stressed that the claims in the Bautista case are \u201cnot related to Smartmatic election security or integrity.\u201d Smartmatic filed massive defamation suits against Fox News, Newsmax, OAN, several individual Fox hosts, ex-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and others. They all deny wrongdoing.  Some of these pro-Trump figures have tried to push back against the defamation suits by highlighting Smartmatic\u2019s ties to Venezuela and its involvement in foreign elections.  OAN recently asked a judge to let them seek records from the Philippines government and other countries as part of the discovery process, claiming they have files about \u201cinvestigations\u2026 scandals.. and major problems\u201d involving Smartmatic machines.  The Smartmatic co-conspirators in the Philippines-related criminal case aren\u2019t identified by name in the court filing obtained by CNN, which says they allegedly \u201ccaused or attempted\u201d to funnel $4 million to Bautista \u201cin violation of US money laundering laws.\u201d According to the charging documents, the Smartmatic executives used \u201cslush funds\u201d and \u201cfake contracts\u201d to facilitate alleged bribes and masked their actions with phony email accounts. \u201cSalsa\u201d was their code word for \u201cmoney,\u201d the documents alleged.  Bautista awarded $199 million in contracts to Smartmatic for about 94,000 voting machines and to handle the results of the Philippines\u2019 presidential election in 2016.  \u201cI did not ask for nor receive any bribe money from Smartmatic or any other entity,\u201d Bautista posted Thursday on X, formerly known as Twitter, adding that the elections he oversaw were \u201chailed\u201d by observers as being the \u201cbest managed\u201d in Filipino history.

Minutes later in the Friday speech, he said \u201cour country has experienced more than 500 mass shootings\u201d so far in 2023 alone; Biden has made one trip this year in connection to a specific mass shooting. He made three such trips in 2021 and 2022 combined.  In March 2023, Biden visited Monterey Park, California, where there was a mass shooting at a dance studio in January. He traveled to Buffalo in May 2022 days after a massacre at a supermarket, then traveled to Uvalde, Texas the same month following a massacre at an elementary school. In 2021, he met with Asian American leaders in Atlanta after a shooting spree at spas there killed eight people including six women of Asian descent. But Biden did not go to the sites of numerous other mass shootings during his presidency, including many that received significant national attention. For example, he did not travel to the sites of shootings this year and last at a mall in Allen, Texas; farms in Half Moon Bay, California; a Christian school in Nashville; a bank in Louisville, Kentucky; a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia; or a parade in Highland Park, Illinois.  And by Biden\u2019s own count, that\u2019s a small fraction of the mass shootings during his presidency. At the time of Biden\u2019s speech, the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit that tracks mass shootings (and defines them as shootings where four or more people were shot or killed, not including the shooter), listed 506 such shootings in 2023. Vice President Kamala Harris visited Highland Park after the shooting there, while first lady Jill Biden visited Nashville in the wake of that shooting.

These charges demonstrate justice is possible no matter how much time has elapsed.\u201d  Kansas City Police Chief Karl Oakman added Davis \u201cwent on with his normal life like nothing happened\u201d after the killings.  \u201cThis is another example where we have taken a dangerous individual off the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my experience, based on him killing two women, most likely he has killed more.\u201d   The chief noted the area has a \u201csignificant number\u201d of unsolved homicides dating back five or six decades and in 2022 the department created a new full time cold case squad.  \u201cThese cases are in various stages of investigation, and we knew we would benefit from advances in DNA forensic testing and simply a fresh look,\u201d Oakman said. \u201cSince January 2022, the detectives in the unit have identified suspects in 11 cold cases.\u201d    CNN has reached out to Davis\u2019 court appointed attorney for comment.

I (saw) the children \u2013 I couldn\u2019t even figure out how many at the time,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey were crying, they were asking for their parents.\u201d The bus was carrying about 40 members of Farmingdale High School\u2019s marching band from Long Island to a band camp in Pennsylvania when tragedy struck in Wawayanda, about 70 miles northwest of New York City.  For reasons still unknown, the bus careened off Interstate 84, crashed through a wire guard rail and flipped over repeatedly down the ravine, Lewis said. He said crews had a difficult time with rescues and accessing those in the bus. Fire crews set up a rope and had to pull up the injured on stretchers to get them into ambulances, Lewis added. \u201cThis was about a 50-foot drop \u2026 off the interstate,\u201d the trooper said. After the bus finally came to a rest, two people were dead: the band\u2019s acclaimed director, Gina Pellettiere, and longtime chaperone, Beatrice Ferrari. Five students remain critically injured in the hospital one day after a bus crash in Orange County, New York killed two people, state police said in a news release Friday afternoon. Twenty-two students have been released from the hospital, according to the release, though it\u2019s unclear how many others remain hospitalized, given those numbers continue to change, state police spokesman Trooper Steve Nevel told CNN.  State police are also asking anyone who may have witnessed the crash or seen the bus before the crash to call New York State Police Troop F with information. Police also asked the public to contact them if they have dashcam video that may have recorded the incident. Preliminary information suggests a faulty front tire may have contributed to the crash, authorities said Thursday evening. But the investigation continues, and a team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived Friday to probe what led up to the tragedy that killed two longtime friends. The agency hasn\u2019t yet spoken with the driver of the bus but is planning to as soon as possible, depending on her injuries, NTSB Investigator in Charge John Humm said during a Friday news conference. Humm said he didn\u2019t know the status of her condition. A team of seven NTSB investigators will remain at the crash site for the next five days to a week, aiming to zero in on factors that may have led to the crash, Humm said. They will also work to determine whether the bus had a dash camera. \u2018She would go out of her way to help students\u2019  Ferrari, 77, taught at Farmingdale High School for 32 years, her daughter Angela Ferrari-Aldieri told CNN. \u201cMy mom loved teaching. She would go out of her way to help students who needed extra help,\u201d her daughter said. \u201cShe would then be so proud when she would see them pass their classes or regents exams because to her, when her students succeeded, she succeeded.\u201d  While at Farmingdale High School, the social studies teacher became close friends with Pellettiere, the marching band director who would later share her final moments with Ferrari.  \u201cMom\u2019s classroom was right across from the band room when they first met,\u201d Ferrari-Aldieri said.  \u201cShe told me that they made a deal and that Gina agreed that her class wouldn\u2019t play their instruments on the days mom\u2019s class had to take a test. After that, they became close friends. So when mom decided to retire, Gina asked her to come back and chaperone the band camp trips.\u201d Ferrari had been chaperoning band camp trips for years. \u201cShe knew how to communicate with the students and spot and nurture talent,\u201d her daughter said. \u201cA lot of them felt comfortable opening up to her. She just knew what to do.\u201d Even in her retirement, Ferrari was known as \u201cthe heart and soul of our marching band program,\u201d Farmingdale School District Superintendent Paul Defendini wrote. In addition to a grieving school community, Ferrari also leaves behind a husband, two daughters and four grandchildren. A \u2018highly regarded and adored\u2019 band director  Pellettiere was a beloved marching band director who also served on the board of the Nassau Music Educators Association, the group posted on Facebook. \u201cGina was the highly regarded and adored wind ensemble and marching band director at Farmingdale HS, and an active member of the music education community across our county, region and state,\u201d the organization wrote. \u201cHer warm smile, infectious laugh, incredible story telling ability, passion for life and talent at her craft will be greatly missed by all who knew her personally and professionally.\u201d \u2018Imagine the fear, the screams and the aftermath\u2019 The band members on board \u201chad a weekend planned of fun and enjoying their musicianship,\u201d Blakeman said. \u201cUnfortunately, the day ended in tragedy.\u201d The bus \u201cliterally tumbled down a 50-foot ravine,\u201d said Gov. Kathy Hochul, who credited first responders for helping save survivors.  \u201cImagine the fear, the screams and the aftermath, when these high school students, many of them freshmen, were surrounded by this chaos,\u201d the governor said. \u201cBut they endured. They were strong. And within 45 minutes, because of the efforts of an incredible amount of team work, these young people and the adults were brought to safety.\u201d When fire and rescue departments responded to the scene, they were \u201cliterally running in the danger, uncertain as to whether or not that bus could explode,\u201d the governor said. The Nassau County official also praised emergency crews for preventing more loss of life. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for (law enforcement and first responders) and all that they did, we would have lost more (people), and they wouldn\u2019t have gotten the care as quickly as they did,\u201d Blakeman said Thursday. \u201cThe only advice I can give to anybody tonight is hug your children very tight.

The guilty plea comes one month after the former counterintelligence head, Charles McGonigal, pleaded guilty in New York to one count of conspiring to violate US sanctions on Russia on separate charges connected to work he did for a sanctioned Russian oligarch in 2021. In the DC case, prosecutors alleged that McGonigal worked to further interests that the former foreign intelligence employee \u2013 now a naturalized US citizen from New Jersey \u2013 had abroad. According to an agreed upon statement of facts, the individual gave McGonigal at least $225,000 in 2017. McGonigal, who pleaded guilty to one count of concealment of material facts in DC, told the federal judge during his plea hearing that the individual was his friend and that they planned to start a consulting firm together when McGonigal retired from the FBI. The money, McGonigal said, was part of a loan for that business \u2013 though in the statement of facts connected to the plea deal, McGonigal agreed that there were no terms to the loan and that he never paid it back. During McGonigal\u2019s time at the FBI, the two traveled to Albania several times and met with the country\u2019s prime minister. McGonigal advocated on behalf of the former intelligence employee to the prime minister over oil field drilling contacts that his friend had a financial interest in. The overseas meetings, which he did not disclose to the FBI, were to develop potential business relationships, McGonigal said. He also told the court he knew that engaging in personal business was not permitted while working for the FBI, and he apologized to the bureau and to his wife. According to the statement of facts, the FBI also opened up an investigation into a US citizen who was lobbying for a political party in Albania \u201cbased in part on information provided by defendant McGonigal and his direction.\u201d In the investigation, McGonigal\u2019s potential future business partner acted as a confidential human source in the investigation, and a foreign Albanian contact McGonigal had met helped facilitate meetings between witnesses in Europe and the FBI, including paying for the witnesses\u2019 travel expenses.

Jason Starr, 50, and his brother, Darin Starr, 54, plotted to kill Jason\u00b4s ex-wife, Sara Starr, after a judge ordered Jason to pay her a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of his income after their divorce, according to prosecutors. Sara Starr was shot to death outside her home in 2017. The jury found them guilty of racketeering murder, and prosecutors say they will face a mandatory sentence of life in prison. \u201cThere is no such thing as a perfect crime,\u201d Assistant US Attorney Joshua Wendell told CNN affiliate WTVY after the verdict. \u201cYou will be caught. You will be prosecuted.\u201d  During the trial, prosecutors argued that Jason, whose net income was about $6,700 a month, had to pay $2,550 a month in child support and alimony to Sara, with whom he had four children, WTVY reported, citing court records.    Over approximately two months, starting in September 2017, Jason Starr sent about $2,600 to his brother Darin, who lived in Texas. During the trial, the jury determined that the money \u201cwas payment for the murder of his ex-wife,\u201d according to the DOJ news release.   On Thursday, Darin Starr\u2019s lawyers, J. Carlton Taylor and Aimee Cobb Smith, told CNN via email that \u201cwe feel the verdict in this case was the result of emotion and speculation, not evidence.\u201d   \u201cDarin Starr intends to pursue all remedies available under the law to have his conviction overturned,\u201d his lawyers added.  CNN has reached out to Jason Starr\u2019s lawyers for comments but has not yet heard back.  Sara Starr was a 38-year-old elementary school teacher and mother of two sets of twins at the time of her killing, WTVY reported. Court records show that she divorced Jason in July 2017 and that they shared their children\u2019s custody.   Cell phone records showed that Darin Starr traveled from Texas to Coffee County in Alabama just before Thanksgiving in 2017, and was very near the home of his brother\u2019s ex-wife on multiple occasions, according to the DOJ news release.  \u201cAround midnight on November 27, 2017, Darin Starr\u2019s phone was turned off. Approximately seven hours later, Darin Starr shot and killed his brother\u2019s ex-wife in her driveway as she was leaving for work,\u201d the release added. \u201cDarin Starr turned his phone back on around 8:00 a.m. when he was on I-10 heading back to Texas.\u201d  During the trial, their defense lawyers told jurors that investigators failed to find a murder weapon or an eyewitness to the crime, WTVY reported.

In a speech in the White House Rose Garden, the president detailed his experience traveling to the sites of mass shootings across the country, including after the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 as vice president. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t think that these kinds of engagements have a permanent effect on young children \u2026 these were hardened, tough cops, asking me, could I get them psychiatric help?\u201d he asked, raising his voice.

The announcement comes just days after a group of congressional Democrats in a letter called on Biden to leverage \u201cthe full power of the executive branch\u201d to combat gun violence. In March, a day after a mass shooting left six dead in Nashville, Biden told reporters, \u201cI have gone the full extent of my executive authority to do, on my own, anything about guns.\u201d  Biden on Friday took the opportunity to tout the steps his administration had taken to address the scourge of gun violence. \u201cTo date my administration has announced dozens of executive actions to reduce gun violence \u2013 more than any of my predecessors at this point in their presidencies, and they include everything from cracking down on ghost guns, breaking up gun trafficking, and so much more,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd last year with the help \u2013 with your help I signed into law the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most significant gun safety law in almost 30 years.

UAW President Shawn Fain made the announcement on Friday morning. \u201cAt noon Eastern today, all parts distributions centers at General Motors and Stellantis will be on strike,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will shut down parts distribution until those two companies come to their senses and come to the table with a serious offer.\u201d But Fain said that there has been significant improvement in offers from Ford and that is the reason the strike will not be expanded there. \u201cWe do want to recognize that Ford is serious about reaching a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cStellantis and GM in particular are going to need some serious pushing.\u201d The strike will now expand to GM\u2019s and Stellantis\u2019s 38 parts and distribution centers spread across 20 states. The distribution centers generally send parts to dealerships to be used for repairs, so the move could quickly cripple dealerships ability to do repairs, which is the most profitable part of their business.  GM said the expanded strike action was \u201cunnecessary\u201d but that it planned to continue bargaining in good faith.  \u201cToday\u2019s strike escalation by the UAW\u2019s top leadership is unnecessary,\u201d the company said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe have contingency plans for various scenarios and are prepared to do what is best for our business, our customers, and our dealers\u2026 We will continue to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible.\u201d Stellantis also expressed disappointment with the union\u2019s actions. \u201cWe question whether the union\u2019s leadership has ever had an interest in reaching an agreement in a timely manner. They seem more concerned about pursuing their own political agendas than negotiating in the best interests of our employees and the sustainability of our US operations given the market\u2019s fierce competition,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThe fact is, we made a very competitive offer yesterday\u2026.And yet, we still have not received a response to that offer. We look forward to the UAW leadership\u2019s productive engagement so that we can bargain in good faith to reach an agreement.\u201d Still, the announcement of progress at Ford raised hopes that the strike, at least at there, could be brought to a relatively quick end. Before Friday, there had been few public signs that the union and management of the three companies were anywhere close to an agreement. \u201cFord is working diligently with the UAW to reach a deal that rewards our workforce and enables Ford to invest in a vibrant and growing future,\u201d Ford said in a statement. \u201cAlthough we are making progress in some areas, we still have significant gaps to close on the key economic issues. In the end, the issues are interconnected and must work within an overall agreement that supports our mutual success.\u201d  The announcement comes just days after Ford reached a tentative deal with the Canadian union Unifor, which averted a strike by more than 5,000 autoworkers in that country that would have shut down its three factories there. While the strike will continue at the three assembly lines already on strike - a Ford truck plant in Wayne, Michigan, a GM plant in Wentzville, Missouri and the Stellantis in Toledo \u2013 there will be no additional factories added, only the parts distribution centers. But that will create great pressure on GM and Stellantis from their network of dealerships. Stellantis sells cars in North America under the Jeep, Ram, Dodge and Chrysler brands. The union had started the strike on September 15 with strikes at only three of the companies\u2019 25 US assembly plants, having about 12,700 of its 145,000 members at the traditional \u201cBig Three\u201d walk off early that morning. About 5,625 UAW members work at the new strike targets announced on Friday. That will bring the grand total of UAW members who will be on strike to just over 18,300. And the strike will now range from coast to coast, with workers at facilities from Virginia to California walking out. Dealerships and repair centers The new strikes are specifically aimed at hurting dealerships. The Big Three car dealerships are not owned by the Big Three companies themselves. Instead, they\u2019re individual franchisees that purchase cars from the manufacturers and then sell them onto customers. Simply selling cars isn\u2019t how those dealerships make a lot of their money, however: The dealerships make a lot of their money from the mechanics in the service centers. Every time a car needs to be repaired, it likely needs a new part, and many drivers bring their cars right into the dealerships to be serviced especially while still under warranty. But the UAW\u2019s expanded strike is now targeting the parts distribution centers for GM and Stellantis. Without new parts being sent to service centers, the dealerships will soon start running out, potentially forcing them to turn away repairs for cars, and heaps of potential revenue.  Without that additional revenue pouring in, the dealership owners themselves could start ratcheting up the pressure on GM and Stellantis to start making concessions to their workers, much in the way Ford has. Ford, which has made concessions on everything from eliminating wage tiers to job security, will see its dealership service centers likely operating as normal. Inflation, previous concessions This is the first time the union has struck all of the Big Three automakers at the same time. Traditionally it has picked one company at a time as a target for its job actions. And most often, it has had all the workers at that company going on strike at the same time. The union insists it is better to go with this new strategy of targeted strikes that disrupt operations but raised the possibility of additional action in the future if the companies do not meet their demands. During Friday\u2019s announcement, Fain made reference to \u201cmaintaining our flexibility and our leverage to escalate as we need to.\u201d  The union began negotiations demanding an immediate 20% raise for its members and a total of 40% in wage hikes during the four-year life of the contract.  It also wants to roll back a number of the concessions the union gave up during negotiations in 2007 and 2009 when Ford was nearly out of cash and GM and Stellantis predecessor Chrysler were both on their way to bankruptcy and federal bailouts. Among those concessions it wants reversed: The UAW wants the companies to offer traditional pension plans and retiree health care for workers hired since 2007, which are now only available to more senior employees. It is also demanding a resumption of cost of living adjustments to protect workers from rising prices, as well as the end of a lower tier of wages and benefits for workers hired since 2007. Heading into Friday, the companies are on record each offering raises of about 20% during the life of the contract, including immediate raises of about 10%.  But despite the companies making record or near-record profits, they say the union demands are not affordable and would place them at a severe competitive disadvantage compared to their nonunion rivals, including Tesla and foreign automakers operating US plants.

Gavin Newsom clears the way for the new regulations. Insurance companies will give priority to homeowners and businesses who have taken steps to harden their properties to disasters like wildfires, floods and windstorms. Lara said this is first-of-its-kind regulation. Once the new regulations are fully implemented, which is expected by December 2024, insurers will be required to have 85% of new policies they write cover property in areas prone to wildfires. Regulators believe that will help Californians to move off the FAIR plan. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get to affordability if we don\u2019t tackle the availability issue,\u201d Lara said. More available options for policies are expected to increase competition for better rates. \u201cThis is yet another example of how climate change is directly threatening our communities and livelihoods.

China produces about 80% of the world\u2019s gallium and about 60% of germanium, according to the Critical Raw Materials Alliance, but it didn\u2019t sell any of the elements on international markets last month, Chinese customs data released on Wednesday showed. In July, the country exported 5.15 metric tons of forged gallium products and 8.1 metric tons of forged germanium products. When asked about the lack of exports last month, He Yadong, a spokesperson from China\u2019s commerce ministry told a press briefing Thursday that the department had received applications from companies to export the two materials. Some applications had been approved, he said, without elaborating.   The curbs are indicative of China\u2019s apparent willingness to retaliate against US export controls, despite concerns about economic growth, as a tech war simmers. The world\u2019s second largest economy is already grappling with weak domestic demand and a housing crisis. Last month, the country\u2019s exports suffered their biggest drop in more than three years, dealing a new blow to its faltering recovery. Analysts say restricting exports is a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d that may hurt the Chinese economy and accelerate the shift of supply chains out of the country. China may be the industry leader in producing the two elements, but there are alternative producers, as well as available substitutes for both materials, Eurasia Group analysts said in a July research report.  The impact of the collapse in exports is already being felt at home. Prices for gallium have fallen in China, as export controls caused inventories to pile up.  On Thursday, the spot price of gallium stood at 1,900 yuan ($260) per metric ton, down nearly 20% from early July, according to information from the Shanghai Metal Market. The spot price of germanium, meanwhile, has increased slightly because of tight supply, reaching 10,050 yuan ($1,376) per metric ton on Thursday. Permission needed In July, Beijing said the two elements, which are used in a variety of products including computer chips and solar panels, would be subject to export controls to protect the country\u2019s \u201cnational security and interests.\u201d Starting August 1, exporters would need to apply for special permission to ship them out of the country. The move has ramped up a tech war with the United States over who has access to advanced chipmaking technology, which is vital for everything from smartphones and self-driving cars to weapons manufacturing. Last October, the Biden administration unveiled a set of export controls banning Chinese companies from buying advanced chips and chip-making equipment without a license.  But for Washington\u2019s campaign to be successful, other countries had to participate. Japan and the Netherlands joined in the effort earlier this year, which further curbed chipmaking exports to China.  Beijing hit back by launching a cybersecurity probe into US chipmaker Micron in April before banning it from selling to Chinese companies working on key infrastructure projects. More chip curbs from Washington may be coming after Huawei introduced the Mate 60 Pro smartphone last month, sending shockwaves through the tech world. The model is powered by an advanced chip, which was created despite US sanctions intended to cut the Chinese tech giant off from such technology.  The release of the Mate 60 Pro has \u201ccreated political pressure\u201d for the United States to escalate sanctions on Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), the Chinese chipmaker believed to have made the semiconductor, Jefferies analysts wrote in a Monday research note. \u201cWe expect Biden to focus on tightening the [chips] ban against China in the fourth quarter,\u201d they added.

As generative artificial intelligence \u2013 the technology that underpins ChatGPT and similar tools \u2013 seeps into seemingly every corner of the internet, large corporations are grappling with whether the increased efficiency it offers outweighs possible copyright and security risks. Some companies are enacting internal bans on generative AI tools as they work to better understand the technology, and others have already begun to introduce the trendy tech to employees in their own ways. Banning AI? Embracing AI? Or bracing for AI? Many prominent companies have entirely blocked internal ChatGPT use, including JPMorgan Chase, Northrup Grumman, Apple, Verizon, Spotify and Accenture, according to AI content detector Originality.AI, with several citing privacy and security concerns. Business leaders have also expressed worries about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere.  When users input information into these tools, \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t know how it\u2019s then going to be used,\u201d Mark McCreary, the co-chair of the privacy and data security practice at law firm Fox Rothschild LLP, told CNN in March. \u201cThat raises particularly high concerns for companies. As more and more employees casually adopt these tools to help with work emails or meeting notes, McCreary said, \u201cI think the opportunity for company trade secrets to get dropped into these different various AI\u2019s is just going to increase.\u201d But the corporate hesitancy to welcome generative AI could be temporary. \u201cCompanies that are on the list of banning generative AI also have working groups internally that are exploring the usage of AI,\u201d Jonathan Gillham, CEO of Originality.AI, told CNN, highlighting how companies in more risk-averse industries have been quicker to take action against the tech while figuring out the best approach for responsible usage. \u201cGiving all of their staff access to ChatGPT and saying \u2018have fun\u2019 is too much of an uncontrolled risk for them to take, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not saying, \u2018holy crap, look at the 10x, 100x efficiency that we can lock when we find out how to do this in a way that makes all the stakeholders happy\u201d in departments such as legal, finance and accounting.  Among media companies that produce news, Insider editor-in-chief Nicholas Carlson has encouraged reporters to find ways to use AI in the newsroom. \u201cA tsunami is coming,\u201d he said in April. \u201cWe can either ride it or get wiped out by it. But it\u2019s going to be really fun to ride it, and it\u2019s going to make us faster and better.\u201d The organization discouraged staff from putting source details and other sensitive information into ChatGPT. Newspaper chain Gannett paused the use of an artificial intelligence tool to write high school sports stories after the technology called LedeAI made several mistakes in sports stories published in The Columbus Dispatch newspaper in August.  Of the companies currently banning ChatGPT, some are discussing future usage once security concerns are addressed. UBS estimated that ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after its launch.  That rapid growth initially left large companies scrambling to find ways to integrate it responsibly. That process is slow for large companies. Meanwhile, website visits to ChatGPT dropped for the third month in a row in August, creating pressure for large tech companies to sustain popular interest in the tools and to find new enterprise applications and revenue models for generative AI products.  \u201cWe at JPMorgan Chase will not roll out genAI until we can mitigate all of the risks,\u201d Larry Feinsmith, JPM\u2019s head of global tech strategy, innovation, and partnerships said at the Databricks Data + AI Summit in June. \u201cWe\u2019re excited, we\u2019re working through those risks as we speak, but we won\u2019t roll it out until we can do this in an entirely responsible manner, and it\u2019s going to take time.\u201d Northrop Grumman said it doesn\u2019t allow internal data on external platforms \u201cuntil those tools are fully vetted,\u201d according to a March report from the Wall Street Journal. Verizon also told employees in a public address in February that ChatGPT is banned \u201c[a]s it currently stands\u201d due to security risks but that the company wants to \u201csafely embrace emerging technology.\u201d Companies creating custom AI tools \u201cThey\u2019re not just waiting to sort things out. I think they\u2019re actively working on integrating AI into their business processes separately, but they\u2019re just doing so in a way that doesn\u2019t compromise their information,\u201d Vern Glaser, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise at the University of Alberta, told CNN. \u201cWhat you\u2019ll see with a lot of the companies that will be using AI strategies, particularly those who have their own unique content, they\u2019re going to end up creating their custom version of generative AI.\u201d Several companies \u2013 and even ChatGPT itself \u2013 seem to have already found their own answers to the corporate world\u2019s genAI security dilemma. Walmart introduced an internal \u201cMy Assistant\u201d tool for 50,000 corporate employees that helps with repetitive tasks and creative ideas, according to an August LinkedIn post from Cheryl Ainoa, Walmart\u2019s EVP of New Businesses and Emerging Technologies, and Donna Morris, Chief People Officer. The tool is intended to boost productivity and eventually help with new worker orientation, according to the post.  Consulting giants McKinsey, PwC and EY are also welcoming genAI through internal, private methods. PwC announced a \u201cGenerative AI factory\u201d and launched its own \u201cChatPwC\u201d  tool in August powered by OpenAI tech to help employees with tax questions and regulations as part of a $1 billion investment for AI capability scaling.  McKinsey introduced \u201cLilli\u201d in August, a genAI solution where employees can pose questions, with the system then aggregating all of the firm\u2019s knowledge and scanning the data to identify relevant \u201cWith Lilli, we can use technology to access and leverage our entire body of knowledge and assets to drive new levels of productivity,\u201d Jacky Wright, a McKinsey senior partner and chief technology and platform officer, wrote in the announcement. content, summarize the main points and offer experts.  EY is investing $1.4 billion in the technology, including \u201cEY.ai EYQ,\u201d an in-house large language model, and AI training for employees, according to a September press release Tools like MyAssistant, ChatPwC and Lilli solve some of the corporate concerns surrounding genAI systems through custom adaptions of genAI tech, offering employees a private, closed alternative that both capitalizes its ability to increase efficiency and eliminates the risk of copyright or security leaks. OpenAI and Microsoft launch \u2018enterprise\u2019 AI tools  The launch of ChatGPT Enterprise may also help quell some fears. The new version of OpenAI\u2019s new tool, announced in August, is specifically for businesses, promising to provide \u201centerprise-grade security and privacy\u201d combined with \u201cthe most powerful version of ChatGPT yet\u201d for businesses looking to jump on the generative AI bandwagon, according to a company blog post. The highly-anticipated announcement from OpenAI comes as the company says employees from over 80% of Fortune 500 companies have already begun using ChatGPT since it launched publicly late last year, according to its analysis of accounts associated with corporate email domains.  In response to the concerns raised by many companies over security, about employees dropping proprietary information into ChatGPT and having that sensitive information potentially emerge as an output by the tool elsewhere, OpenAI\u2019s announcement blog post for ChatGPT Enterprise states that it does \u201cnot train on your business data or conversations, and our models don\u2019t learn from your usage.\u201d In July, Microsoft unveiled a business-specific version of its AI-powered Bing tool, dubbed Bing Chat Enterprise, and promised much of the same security assurances that ChatGPT Enterprise is now touting \u2013 namely, that users\u2019 chat data will not be used to train AI models. It is still unclear whether the new tools will be enough to convince corporate America that it is time to fully embrace generative AI, though experts agree the tech\u2019s inevitable entry into the workplace will take time and strategy.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that companies are against AI and against machine learning, per se. I think most companies are going to be trying to use this type of technology, but they have to be careful with it because of the impacts on intellectual property,\u201d Glaser said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T20:46:32Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922150010-02-one-fair-wage-fundraiser-0921.jpg?c=original", "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Natasha Rothwell roll up their sleeves to bring attention to restaurant worker wages", "content": "Several stars took a moment this week to focus on a cause that\u2019s getting considerably less attention than striking actors and writers \u2013 specifically, the subpar pay and conditions facing the vast majority of US restaurant workers. Chrissy Teigen and Jamie Lee Curtis were just two of the familiar faces on hand at a One Fair Wage event in West Hollywood on Thursday night, where they donned aprons and brandished memo pads to take patrons\u2019 orders and serve them drinks and food at popular Mexican vegan eatery Gracias Madre. The goal: to bring awareness to the sub-minimum wage still earned by many restaurant workers, a staggering $2.13 an hour at the federal level, allowed by law due to tips earned on top but in reality a number that keeps many restaurant workers and others well under the poverty line. Curtis called the moment the \u201cseason of the worker,\u201d referencing the dual Hollywood strikes, the auto workers strike as well as the plight facing minimum and sub-minimum wage workers. She called the latter group a \u201cmajority (that is) underserved, underfed, and underpaid, and it\u2019s just time.\u201d Natasha Rothwell, who rose to fame thanks to her now-iconic turn as beleaguered hotel wellness worker Belinda in Season 1 of \u201cThe White Lotus,\u201d called the $2.13 wage \u201cdisgusting.\u201d \u201cI think that when you are at a restaurant, recognizing that the people that are bringing out the food, filling up your water, they\u2019re human who have lives and needs that need to be met, and financial needs that needs to be met,\u201d the Emmy-nominated actor told CNN. \u201cOur responsibility as a collective is to make sure that they get what they need.\u201d Having previously worked at McDonald\u2019s, Blockbuster and Target before her acting career took off, Rothwell also referenced her character Belinda.  \u201cPlaying an iconic character that is in the service industry and is looked over, it\u2019s extra important to bring awareness to what this means to women of color,\u201d she observed. One Fair Wage points to how sub-minimum wages impact a workforce that is 70 percent women and 43 percent people of color.  Teigen, who previously did work as a server (\u201cat the late, great, Hooters of Newport Beach,\u201d she said), recalled \u201cdealing with the same wages day in and day out\u201d and how \u201cyou\u2019re relying solely on the roller-coaster that is tips.\u201d \u201cNow, it\u2019s important for me to give those same people the respect and dignity they deserve by being able to go home and feed their own families with a living wage and to be able to call attention to the disparity that is happening within that industry.\u201d \u201cI think a lot of people haven\u2019t heard of the word \u2018sub-minimum\u2019 wage,\u201d Teigen also said. \u201cFor a lot of people, minimum means the word minimum, as it should. The fact that there is a below that is sickening. These people are the people that are working holidays. Nights. The nights that are special to us, the nights that create memories.\u201d Currently, only eight states in the country pay all workers minimum wage or above, Teigen shared. One Fair Wage is trying to change that and eradicate the federal sub-minimum wage. When it comes to tipping in restaurants, all the stars interviewed highlighted how important it was to tip well, but Oscar-winner Curtis stood out. \u201cI\u2019m a monster tipper,\u201d she said. \u201cI do like a 100-150% tip.

In addition, US District Judge Beryl Howell on Friday ordered the former New York mayor to pay an additional $104,000 to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, a mother and daughter he defamed, for additional legal fees they\u2019ve incurred because of his failure to respond to parts of their lawsuit. This is the latest difficulty for Giuliani as he faces fallout from his work for Donald Trump after the 2020 election.  Giuliani has struggled to pay legal bills in recent months, including related to the lawsuit from  Freeman and Moss. The bill of $132,856 is only a small chunk of the financial burden Giuliani is currently under, largely because of his ongoing legal troubles, and it\u2019s one he\u2019s known of for several weeks.  But a court filing on Thursday confirmed Giuliani has not paid the amount to Moss and Freeman, which a judge ordered to offset some of their attorneys\u2019 fees. \u201cAs of the date of this filing, Defendant Giuliani has failed to take any of the actions, or to cause the Giuliani Businesses to take any of the actions, so-ordered in the Sanctions Order,\u201d Moss and Freeman\u2019s lawyers wrote on Thursday, according to the filing. \u201cPlaintiffs are considering what further relief may be appropriate.\u201d Giuliani\u2019s failure to respond to subpoenas for records in Moss and Freeman\u2019s lawsuit led to the sanctioned amount, which is now accruing interest as he continues to not pay.

Just days ago, he also faced a new lawsuit from his former attorney for $1.3 million in unpaid legal fees, and other lawsuits against him are ongoing. Giuliani lost the defamation lawsuit in August from the two Georgia election workers against him after he failed to provide information sought in subpoenas. In court in recent weeks, Giuliani said he could no longer contest that he made false and defamatory statements about Freeman and Moss.  The two are asking for unspecified damages after they say they suffered emotional and reputational harm, as well as having their safety put in danger, after Giuliani singled them out when he made false claims of ballot tampering in Georgia after the 2020 election. Giuliani\u2019s statements about them, which Freeman and Moss say are false, included calling them ballot-stuffing criminal conspirators. Giuliani also drew attention to a video of them after the election, which was first posted by the Trump campaign and showed part of a security tape of ballot counting in Atlanta. On social media, his podcast and other broadcasts, Giuliani said the video showed suitcases filled with ballots, when it did not capture anything but normal ballot processing, according to the defamation lawsuit and a state investigation.

But the search came up empty, according to court documents unsealed this week in US federal court. Seamus Hughes, an independent researcher and founder of Court Watch, shared the documents with CNN.  The court records show how difficult it can be to shut down cybercriminal gangs, often based in Eastern Europe and Russia, that operate like well-oiled multinational corporations and fleece Americans out of millions of dollars. Unless they\u2019re arrested, the hackers can sometimes recover from law enforcement seizures of their computer infrastructure and rebuild their fraudulent empires.  The records were unsealed in the US District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, where the FBI is investigating Emotet operatives after their malware was used in a ransomware attack on a North Carolina school district in 2017.  A spokesperson for the FBI declined to answer questions about the new court records or the status of the Emotet investigation. GoDaddy declined to comment on why the search warrant came up empty.  Emotet (both the name of the malicious code and the hackers\u2019 army of infected computers) has cost US state and local governments $1 million per hacking incident, according to federal data.  It is exactly the type of cybercriminal enterprise that the US government has sought to aggressively dismantle in recent years through a campaign of arrests, computer seizures and offensives from US military hackers. The accelerated Western law enforcement actions have come as the Russian government has balked at cooperating with investigators and the war in Ukraine has uprooted cybercriminals in that country.  Investigative leads from the war in Ukraine In January 2021, the FBI alongside Dutch, British and other European law enforcement agencies announced that they had infiltrated Emotet\u2019s servers and cut off the hackers\u2019 access to victim computers. Ukrainian police also seized computers allegedly used by the hackers.  But hackers associated with the group have continued to rebuild their infrastructure, and they blasted out another campaign of spam emails in March, according to researchers. Experts who track the group told CNN they haven\u2019t observed Emotet activity in months, raising questions about where they might surface next \u2013 or if their operations had suffered a mortal blow and law enforcement agencies were closing in on the hackers.  The FBI and European allies said last month that they had dismantled Qakbot, another network of infected computers that is similar to Emotet. A senior FBI official told CNN at the time that the investigation into Qakbot and related activity is ongoing.  The new court documents also show how the chaos unleashed by the war in Ukraine has provided investigative leads, and challenges, for the FBI in its hunt for cybercriminals.  At the onset of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a Ukrainian cybersecurity researcher leaked a trove of private chats from Conti, another cybercriminal gang that has alleged ties to Russian intelligence. The Ukrainian told CNN that he leaked the data to get revenge on the Russian cybercriminals after they swore allegiance to the Kremlin, and \u201cto prove that they are motherf**kers.\u201d  The new court documents are perhaps the first time the FBI has publicly corroborated the Conti leaks. Those leaks were authentic, the FBI agent said in an affidavit filed in in the Emotet case, and showed that at least one of the Emotet hackers was administering the group\u2019s malicious code both before the January 2021 law enforcement bust and in the years since.  \u201cSophisticated adversaries go to great lengths to stay anonymous and build layers of resiliency in their operations,\u201d said Michael DeBolt, a former US representative to Interpol who is now chief intelligence officer at security firm Intel 471. \u201cFor law enforcement, investigating and eventually prosecuting prolific cybercriminals requires a great deal of patience and perseverance.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T18:05:15Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230201161057-people-who-live-on-planes-card.jpg?c=original", "title": "The people who live inside airplanes", "content": "After losing her house to a fire, Jo Ann Ussery had a peculiar idea: to live in an airplane.  She bought an old Boeing 727 that was destined for the scrapyard, had it shipped to a plot of land she already owned, and spent six months renovating, doing most of the work by herself. By the end, she had a fully functional home, with over 1,500 square feet of living space, three bedrooms, two bathrooms and even a hot tub \u2013 where the cockpit used to be. All for less than $30,000, or about $60,000 in today\u2019s money. Ussery \u2013 a beautician from Benoit, Mississippi \u2013 had no professional connection to aviation, and was following the offbeat suggestion of her brother-in-law, an air traffic controller. She lived in the plane from 1995 to 1999, when it was irreparably damaged after falling off the truck that was moving it to a different location nearby, where it would have been open for public display.  Although she wasn\u2019t the first person to ever live in an airplane, her flawless execution of the project had an inspirational effect. In the late 1990s, Bruce Campbell, an electrical engineer with a private pilot license, was awestruck by her story: \u201cI was driving home and listening to [the radio,] and they had Jo Ann\u2019s story, and it was amazing I didn\u2019t drive off the road because my focus turned entirely to it. And the next morning I was placing phone calls,\u201d he says. A 727 in the woods Campbell has now been living in his own plane \u2013 also a Boeing 727 \u2013 for over 20 years, in the woods of Hillsboro, Oregon: \u201cI still stand on Jo Ann\u2019s shoulder and I\u2019m grateful for the proof of concept.\u201d He has no regrets: \u201cI would never live in a conventional home. No chance. If Scotty beamed me to inner Mongolia, erased my fingerprints and forced me to live in a conventional structure, I\u2019d do what I have to do to survive \u2013 but otherwise, it\u2019s a jetliner for me anytime.\u201d That\u2019s not to say he wouldn\u2019t do anything differently: \u201cI made a lot of mistakes, including the whopper-class one: partnering with a salvage firm. Avoiding that and using superior transport logistics renders the costs much lower,\u201d he explains.  His project cost $220,000 in total (about $380,000 in today\u2019s money), of which roughly half was for the purchase of the plane. He says the plane belonged to Olympic Airways in Greece and was even used to transport the remains of the airline\u2019s magnate owner, Aristotle Onassis, in 1975: \u201cI didn\u2019t know the plane\u2019s history at the time. And I didn\u2019t know that it had an old, 707-style interior. It was really, really awful compared to modern standards. It was functional but it just looked old and crude. Maybe the worst choice for a home.\u201d As a result, Campbell had to work on the plane for a couple of years before being able to live in it. The interiors are no-frills, with a primitive shower made out of a plastic cylinder and a futon sofa for a bed. During the harshest part of winter Campbell traditionally retreats to Miyazaki, a city in southern Japan with subtropical weather where he owns a small apartment. But the pandemic has made this difficult, and for the past three years he\u2019s been living in the 727 year-round. Intending to set up an airplane home in Japan as well, in 2018 he says he almost bought a second aircraft \u2013 a 747-400 \u2013 but the deal fell out at the last minute, because the airline (which Campbell won\u2019t reveal) decided to keep the aircraft in service for longer than expected: \u201cWe had to put the project on hold and it stands that way to this day,\u201d he says. Campbell frequently gets visitors and even offers lodging in the aircraft free of charge, while in the summer he hosts larger public events with funfair attractions: \u201cArtists perform on the right wing, guests dance in front or behind the wing in the forest, which for the big concerts becomes filled with all sorts of recreational venues. They\u2019re not Disneyland class \u2013 just portable booths with different curiosities and little recreations, but they\u2019re fun.\u201d  Double fuselage If you think living in an airplane is extravagant enough, how about living in two? That\u2019s the plan for Joe Axline, who owns an MD-80 and DC-9, sitting next to each other in a plot of land in Brookshire, Texas. Axline has lived in the MD-80 for over a decade \u2013 after getting divorced on April Fool\u2019s Day in 2011 \u2013 and is planning to renovate the DC-8 and equip it with recreational areas such as a movie theater and a music room. He calls his grand plan \u201cProject Freedom.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got less than a quarter of a million dollars in the whole project,\u201d says Axline, who has very few running expenses because he owns the land and has built his own water well and sewer system: \u201cThe only thing that I have still left is electricity,\u201d he adds. For years, he even shared the plane with his children: \u201cThe kids are gone now, so it\u2019s just me. Living in a house, you have a lot of space, but it\u2019s all wasted space. My master bedroom is 10 feet by 18, which is not a bad size for a bedroom. I\u2019ve got two TVs in it, plenty of space to walk around. My living room is good-sized, the dining room seats four, I can cook enough food for a whole bunch of people if they come over. I also have a shower and a toilet, so I don\u2019t have to get out of the airplane to go to the restroom. The only thing that I don\u2019t have here that I would have in a house is windows that open,\u201d he explains, adding that he just opens the plane\u2019s doors to let fresh air in. The planes are visible from nearby roads, and Axline says that many drivers \u2013 their curiosity piqued \u2013 end up stopping by: \u201cI have three or four people every single day. I call them my turistas,\u201d he says. \u201cThey drive by and think, it\u2019s so cool. Most of the time I wave them all over. I\u2019ll say, if you got some time, I\u2019ll give you a tour. And if I didn\u2019t make the bed that day, who cares? Let\u2019s see how real people live.\u201d Axline too was interested in a Boeing 747 \u2013 living in the \u201cQueen of the Skies\u201d is the airplane homeowner\u2019s ultimate dream \u2013 but he gave up when he was confronted with the shipping costs: \u201cThe airplane itself was about $300,000, but the shipping cost was $500,000. Half a million dollars to move it. That\u2019s because you can\u2019t drive it through the roads, you\u2019d have to tear it apart, cut it up, slice it and dice it and then put it back together.\u201d  Airplane DIY There are other notable examples of airplanes converted to homes. One of the earliest is a Boeing 307 Stratoliner once owned by billionaire and film director Howard Hughes, who spent a fortune remodeling the interior to turn it into a \u201cFlying Penthouse.\u201d After being damaged by a hurricane, it was turned into an extravagant motoryacht and eventually purchased in the 1980s by Florida resident Dave Drimmer, who extensively renovated it and renamed it \u201cThe Cosmic Muffin.\u201d He lived in the plane-boat hybrid for 20 years, before eventually donating it to the Florida Air Museum in 2018. American country singer and Nashville Hall of Famer Red Lane, who had a past as a plane mechanic, lived for decades in a converted DC-8 that he saved from the scrapyard in the late 1970s. Lane, who passed away in 2015, also had no regrets: \u201cI have never, ever woke up in this place wishing I was somewhere else,\u201d he revealed in a 2006 TV interview. Those who want to experience a night or two in an airplane home have a few options in the form of hotels; in Costa Rica, the Costa Verde hotel boasts a fully refurbished Boeing 727 \u2013 complete with two bedrooms and an ocean view terrace; in Sweden, Jumbo Stay is a hotel built entirely inside a Boeing 747, sitting on the grounds of Stockholm\u2019s Arlanda Airport. And if you\u2019re just looking to party, there\u2019s another Boeing 747 that can be hired for events with up to 220 people, at Cotswold Airport in England, about 100 miles west of London. If you want to leave transitional housing behind and fully take to life inside a fuselage, however, you must be ready for challenges: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a passion for wanting to do this, because there\u2019ll be so many problems that you\u2019ll need to address that it can become overwhelming,\u201d says Joe Axline, who lists sourcing the right airframe and finding a suitable location for it among the biggest hurdles.  That is perhaps why several of Bruce Campbell\u2019s visitors over the years expressed interest in adopting this lifestyle, but none ever turned the dream into reality: \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty difficult for people: a few of my guests left convinced they wanted to do it and I sent them articulated instructions to help them along step by step, but none have established momentum,\u201d he says. But don\u2019t let that discourage you, Campbell adds: \u201cMy primary advice is do it. Don\u2019t let anybody shake your confidence. Work out all the logistics, and just do it.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-02-02T11:19:07Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922104132-01-iphone-15-launch-0922-london.jpg?c=original", "title": "iPhone 15 hits shelves around the world. Here\u2019s what you need to know", "content": "Apple\u2019s iPhone 15 lineup hit stores Friday as people waited in long lines across China, Europe and the US to be among the first to get their hands on one of the company\u2019s next-generation smartphones. Leading up to launch day, analysts at firms such as Wedbush Securities have reported iPhone 15 pre-orders tracking much stronger than originally expected, with a heavy demand on its premium iPhone 15 Pro offerings, especially the Pro Max. Delivery and shipment times have moved to late October through mid-November for various Pro models.  The new iPhones come as Apple\u2019s sales fell for the third consecutive quarter last month. iPhone revenue came in at $39.7 billion for the quarter, marking an approximately 2% year-over-year decline, as people update their devices less often. According to Wedbush estimates, about 250 million iPhones have not been upgraded in more than four years. Advancements made to the processor and camera system, along with discounts from mobile carriers, could be more than enough reason for people to finally upgrade this year. The iPhone 15 Pro starts at $1,099, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at $1,199. Apple\u2019s entry level iPhones, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, cost $799 and $899, respectively.  Here\u2019s a closer look at what\u2019s new: iPhone 15 lineup is packed with subtle design changes The latest iPhones are packed with subtle but significant design changes. To start, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now feature a titanium casing, allowing the design to be slimmer and thinner than before. Other design changes on the premium models include a more-advanced 48 megapixel main camera with a larger sensor and a new telephoto lens for 5x optical zoom camera, exclusively on iPhone 15 Pro Max. The new Pro models\u2019 design also features contoured edges and a customizable Action button, which gives the ring/silence button additional controls, from starting a voice memo to writing a note. The Pro line comes in four colors: white, black, natural and blue.  Meanwhile, the basic iPhone 15 phones now include updated image stabilization for taking photos and videos, 2x optimization and updated portraits with richer color and better low-light performance. They will also come with the \u201cDynamic Island\u201d tool \u2014 home to alerts, notifications and other controls, in place of the notch \u2014 which were previously only available on the iPhone 14 Pro.  The iPhone 15 lineup also includes an Ultra-Wideband chip to power a handful of new features, including one that makes it easier to find friends who share their location in crowded areas. The iPhone 15 comes in 5 colors (white, black, pink, green and yellow) and in two sizes: A 6.1-inch screen for the iPhone 15 and 6.7 inches for iPhone 15 Pro. A milestone step toward universal charging Perhaps the biggest change coming to the iPhone 15 models is that they will now use a USB-C charging cord, ending an 11-year run with Apple\u2019s proprietary Lightning charging cable.  Now Apple customers can use the same USB-C chargers to power their iPhones, iPads and Mac computers \u2014 no more scrambling to find the right charger for each device. Apple said a dedicated USB-C controller will allow for transfer speeds of up to 20 times faster than with USB-2 technology for the iPhone 15 Pro. The switch comes less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device, and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers. Apple is also selling a $29 USB-C Lightning adapter to let people connect their existing Lightning accessories to a USB-C-enabled iPhone or iPad to charge or share data.  The company told CNN that iPhone users can recycle their old Lightning chargers via its in-store recycling program.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T16:52:32Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922092842-01-nikki-haley-092123.jpg?c=original", "title": "Nikki Haley unveils economic proposal while slamming both parties over government spending", "content": "Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Friday unveiled her economic proposal \u2013 which includes cutting middle-class taxes, tackling inflation and reducing federal government control \u2013 while calling out both Democrats and Republicans over what she referred to as \u201creckless\u201d federal spending. \u201cJoe Biden is proving that reckless spending is the road to socialism. But he\u2019s not the only culprit. Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Barack Obama added more to our national debt than the previous 42 presidents combined. They tripled the debt from $10 trillion to $33 trillion,\u201d Haley, who served under Trump as his ambassador to the United Nations, said in remarks at St. Anselm College\u2019s New Hampshire Institute of Politics in Manchester.  \u201cWe\u2019re now adding a trillion more every year, with no end in sight. Our children will never forgive us for this,\u201d the former South Carolian governor said Friday, as a potential government shutdown looms with lawmakers in Washington yet to reach a deal to extend funding past the September 30 deadline. Haley\u2019s remarks came just days ahead of the second Republican presidential debate in California, with the 2024 contender seeing a bump in GOP primary polling since her performance at the first debate in Milwaukee last month.  On the campaign trail, Haley has sought to seek a balance between criticism and praise for her onetime boss. While she called Trump the right president for the right time at a recent campaign stop in New Hampshire, she criticized his handling of the economy while in office, asserting that he \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything on fiscal policy and really spent a lot of money, and we\u2019re all paying the price for it.\u201d Haley\u2019s proposal unveiled Friday is part of her larger plan to revive America\u2019s middle class and an attempt to reverse the Biden administration\u2019s economic policies, dubbed by the White House as \u201cBidenomics.\u201d \u201cJoe Biden has created a political subsidy economy. That\u2019s what Bidenomics really is. The government is taking money from the middle class and giving it to everyone else. The well-connected are getting wealthier through corporate welfare, while the poor get trapped in regular welfare,\u201d Haley told the New Hampshire audience.  Dubbed \u201cThe Freedom Plan,\u201d Haley\u2019s proposal would eliminate the federal gas and reduce income tax rates, make small-business tax relief permanent, and end certain tax deductions such as the deduction for state and local income taxes, also known as SALT. Haley, who graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting from Clemson University, often touts her financial background on the campaign trail, telling voters, \u201cIt\u2019s time to put an accountant in the White House.\u201d \u201cMy tax cuts will put thousands of dollars in middle-class families\u2019 pockets,\u201d she said Friday.   Haley believes funding for infrastructure projects should come from general revenues, forcing them to compete with other spending priorities. Additionally, her plan would place a limit on federal spending, linked to a percentage of the economy. Since launching her presidential campaign in February, Haley has often vowed that if elected, she will \u201cstop the spending\u201d and \u201cstop the borrowing,\u201d while emphasizing her plans to \u201cclaw back\u201d $500 billion of unspent Covid-19 funds. Under her proposal, Haley would veto any budget that doesn\u2019t contribute to reducing the US economy to pre-Covid spending levels, eliminate $500 billion in green energy subsidies and implement mandatory zero-based budgeting. The plan would also implement Social Security and Medicare reforms for younger generations. In her remarks Friday, Haley called for term limits for politicians and said \u201cbureaucrats\u201d would not be able to hold the same position for more than five years, under her plan. She also pledged to meet with governors once a quarter and to encourage states on ways to empower their communities. Haley reflected on her time as South Carolina governor, ticking off economic statistics that she said earned her state the moniker \u201cBeast of the Southeast\u201d by trade magazines. \u201cIf we did it there, we can do it across our entire country. We just need vision, discipline and determination,\u201d she said.  This story and headline have been updated.

Starting on January 1, those operators will have to pay a 5% royalty rate, up from 4%, according to the company. The royalty fee is a monthly percentage of sales.  The change won\u2019t apply to all franchise operators. The rate will stay the same for those currently running McDonald\u2019s locations who extend their leases, as well as those selling their franchises to other operators. Those opening a franchise for the first time or buying a restaurant, in specific scenarios, will have to pay the new rate.  McDonald\u2019s will also stop using the term \u201cservice fee\u201d or \u201cservice charge,\u201d switching instead to the word \u201croyalty,\u201d a move the company said should reduce confusion.  Company executives shared the news Friday with employees and franchisees in letters seen by CNN. In one, McDonald\u2019s US president Joe Erlinger said the change would help align the North American market with the international market, where the royalty fee is generally at 5%, and better reflects the value of the brand. Franchises are a key part of McDonald\u2019s business, with roughly 95% of all McDonald\u2019s locations operated by franchise operators.  Operators pay a royalty rate to use McDonald\u2019s brand and for access to its expertise. They also help pay for other expenses, like restaurant renovations. The costs have led to tensions between the company and operators in the past. In 2018, McDonald\u2019s franchise operators formed their first-ever advocacy group, the National Owners Association. For now, the changes will impact a relatively small number of restaurants, the company said.  McDonald\u2019s estimated that the change would \u201cbe limited to hundreds of restaurants in the US and Canada in a given year,\u201d in a document posted to its investor site. The rate will apply to more restaurants over time, it added. As of last year, there were about 13,400 McDonald\u2019s locations in the US, and about 40,300 globally.    \u201cWe\u2019re always looking ahead,\u201d when thinking about franchisees, said McDonald\u2019s CEO Chris Kempczinski during an analyst call this summer. \u201cThis requires making decisions for the long term to earn our success rather than expecting it or assuming it.\u201d It may be a good time for McDonald\u2019s (MCD) to make the case that aspiring franchise operators should pay more.  \u201cThe strength of our momentum in the US actually means that our owner-operator cash flow is up year-over-year,\u201d said CFO Ian Borden during the same analyst call.  Sales at McDonald\u2019s US locations open at least 13 months grew 10.3% in the quarter ending June 30. And while other chains struggle to bring more customers into restaurant locations, McDonald\u2019s is reporting growth in US traffic.

While in Bordeaux, a region with deep historical ties to Britain, the couple toured a Royal Navy frigate, met local business owners and learned about the devastating impact of last year\u2019s wildfires.  Outside of Paris, Bordeaux was one of the worst-affected cities when major protests over pension reforms erupted six months ago, leading to the postponement of the royal visit. Charles and Camilla instead flew to Germany for the first overseas trip of his reign.  It\u2019s been a successful few days for the British monarch and his wife. The King and Queen were greeted by their French hosts at Paris\u2019 Arc de Triomphe on Wednesday in an extravagant display of pageantry, complete with a symbolic lighting ceremony and theatrical flypast.  The King and President Emmanuel Macron appeared at ease with each other. Their body language was comfortable and tactile, with signs of a genuinely warm friendship.  A highlight of the visit will no doubt be Charles\u2019 speech Thursday at the French senate, housed at the magnificent Palais du Luxembourg. To make an address from the floor of the upper house of the French parliament is a rare honor afforded to few heads of state, but it was a crowd-pleaser.  A buzz of excitement hung in the air long before the 74-year-old monarch was ushered into the gilded room. And despite the address coming during a parliamentary recess, delighted lawmakers returned a week early to fill the chamber. It was a big moment, but Charles did not disappoint. He delivered a large part of the speech in French and repeatedly returned to the trip\u2019s central theme of underscoring the deep historical ties between the two allies.  After all, Charles is here at the request of the UK government, and while it would have had final approval over the messaging, the monarch\u2019s fingerprints on the speech were plain. His predecessors might have simply read remarks provided to them, but this monarch is more involved in the process.  The King cracked a few jokes \u2013 though not as many as when he spoke at Berlin\u2019s Bundestag in March \u2013 and deployed his strongest language while reiterating his \u201cresolute solidarity\u201d with the Ukrainian people against Russia\u2019s \u201cunprovoked aggression\u201d and highlighting the \u201cexistential challenge\u201d of the climate crisis.  It ended with a lengthy standing ovation from politicians. Charles almost seemed not to know what to do with himself as his words went down far better than perhaps even he expected, and he couldn\u2019t sit down until the applause was over.  Another element that looks likely to become a staple of state visits from King Charles is the focus on green issues. In both this trip and his visit to Germany, conservation, sustainability and other environmental engagements featured heavily in his busy schedule.  While royal trips are routinely tailored to the individual, some may have thought that would end for Charles when he became sovereign. Instead, he\u2019s leaning into their inclusion \u2013 his way of keeping the spotlight on causes he cares about but within the constraints of his new role.  The King faced criticism from some quarters Friday for flying between Paris and Bordeaux, as some short-haul flights are prohibited in France in a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, palace officials said a plan to travel by train was changed for security reasons after leaks in local media.  Throughout the trip, French news broadcasters went into daily special programming, with their commentators dissecting every move in their hours-long coverage. The visit also dominated French newspaper front pages as articles highlighted how Charles was reinvigorating the French-UK relationship after years of divisive political episodes like Brexit.  After Charles\u2019 inaugural state visit to France was interrupted at the 11th hour back in March, the palace as well as the governments on both sides of the Channel will be satisfied by how the royal tour has played out this time round.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T17:00:22Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/211124144641-5-steps-habit-builder-wellness-112421.jpg?q=w_4000,h_2667,x_0,y_0,c_fill", "title": "How to build a habit in 5 steps, according to science", "content": "Most of us assume those superachievers who are always able to squeeze in their workout, eat healthy foods, ace their exams and pick their kids up on time must have superhuman self-control. But science points to a different answer: What we mistake for willpower is often a hallmark of habit.   People with good habits rarely need to resist the temptation to laze on the couch, order greasy takeout, procrastinate on assignments or watch one more viral video before dashing out the door. That\u2019s because autopilot takes over, eliminating temptation from the equation. Having established good habits, little to no willpower is required to choose wisely.  Sounds great, right? The only catch is that building good habits takes effort and insight. Thankfully, science offers both guidance on how to begin and strategies to lighten your lift. Here are a few research-backed steps sourced from my book, \u201cHow to Change,\u201d that can set you on the path from where you are to where you want to be.  1. Set a specific goal The way you define the goal you hope to turn into a habit does matter. Goals such as \u201cmeditate regularly\u201d are too abstract, research has shown. You\u2019ll benefit from being more specific about what exactly you aim to do and how often.   Don\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019ll meditate regularly.\u201d Say, \u201cI\u2019ll meditate for 15 minutes each day.\u201d   Having a bite-size objective makes it less daunting to get started and easier to see your progress. 2. Create a detailed, cue-based plan Now that you have established a specific goal, it\u2019s time to think about what will cue you to follow through. Scientists have proven that you\u2019ll make more progress toward your goal if you decide not just what you\u2019ll do, but when you\u2019ll be cued to do it, as well as where you\u2019ll do it and how you\u2019ll get there.   A plan like \u201cI\u2019ll study Spanish for 30 minutes, five days a week\u201d is OK. But a detailed, cue-based plan like \u201cEvery workday after my last meeting, I\u2019ll spend 30 minutes studying Spanish in my office\u201d is much more likely to stick as a habit.    Making this kind of plan reduces the chances you\u2019ll forget to follow through because the when and where in your plan will serve as cues to action that jog your memory. Even better: Put your plan on your calendar so you\u2019ll get a digital reminder. An established, hyperspecific plan also forces you to anticipate and maneuver around obstacles and makes procrastination feel more sinful.  3. Make it fun to repeat When we set out to build a new habit, most of us overestimate our willpower and set a course for the most efficient path to achieving our end goal. Say you hope to get fit by exercising regularly \u2014 you\u2019ll likely look for a workout that can generate quick results such as grinding it out on a treadmill. But research has shown you\u2019ll persist longer and ultimately achieve more if you instead focus on finding ways to make goal pursuit fun.  When it comes to exercise, this might mean going to Zumba classes with a friend or learning how to rock climb. If you\u2019re trying to eat more fruits and vegetables, it might mean swapping doughnut breakfasts for tasty smoothies, which can combine multiple servings of fruits and veggies in one delicious drink. Because you are far more likely to stick with something you enjoy and repetition is key to habit formation, making the experience positive is critical, but it\u2019s often overlooked.  One excellent way to make goal pursuit fun is to try what I call \u201ctemptation bundling.\u201d Consider only letting yourself enjoy an indulgence you crave while working toward your goal. For example, only let yourself binge-watch your favorite show while at the gym or enjoy a beloved podcast while cooking healthy meals. My own research shows that temptation bundling improves follow-through; it transforms goal pursuit into a source of pleasure, not pain. 4. Foster flexibility  By the time we put a behavior on autopilot, a lot of us fall into fairly consistent routines, tending to exercise, study or take our medication at the same time of day and in the same place. But when you\u2019re in the start-up phase of habit building, contrary to popular opinion, my research suggests it\u2019s important to insert some variability deliberately into your routine.   You\u2019ll still want to have a first best plan \u2014 maybe an 8 a.m. meditation session if you\u2019re trying to kick-start a mindfulness habit. But you should also experiment with other ways of getting the job done. Try to mix in a noon session and maybe a 5 p.m. meditation, too.   Successful habit building relies on frequently repeating a behavior, and if your routine becomes too brittle, you\u2019ll follow through less often. A flexible habit means you can still do what you need to even when a wrench is thrown in your first best plans \u2014 say, a traffic jam on the way to dropping the kids off at school that gets in the way of your morning meditation.  One way to be flexible that\u2019s proven useful is by giving yourself \u201cemergency reserves.\u201d Emergency reserves are a limited number of get-out-of-jail-free cards for those days when you really can\u2019t squeeze in your 10 minutes of meditation, regular jog or Spanish practice.  It\u2019s more motivating to set a tough goal for yourself \u2014 meditating every day, for instance \u2014 than an easy one, according to research. But missing multiple subgoals along the way can be discouraging. A couple of emergency reserves each week give you the flexibility to miss a day when a real emergency arises without getting discouraged and abandoning your objective entirely.   5. Find the right kind of social support This step is obvious but sometimes overlooked. Seek out social support. Social support isn\u2019t just about having cheerleaders and people to hold you accountable \u2014 though both can add value, so I\u2019d suggest telling your friends and family about your goals.    We\u2019re strongly influenced by the behaviors of the people around us, evidence shows. Want to start running regularly? You\u2019re probably better off joining an established running club than asking a few friends who aren\u2019t yet in the habit of jogging to get in shape with you. People in the running club have already built the habits you want. You can learn from them about what works and gain friends who will make you feel like a slouch when you slack off.  Good habits are contagious, so try to catch some by hanging out with people who are a little ahead of you on the learning curve. It\u2019s important not to get too crazy \u2014 if you try to train with marathoners when you\u2019re just hoping to work up to a 5K, I\u2019ve found it can be discouraging.  But in general, research by myself and others shows that finding people to socialize with and emulating those who have already accomplished what you want to accomplish can make a world of difference. As an added bonus, when you pursue your goals in tandem with people you like, that makes it more fun! One last thing to keep in mind is that habits can take some time to form. They don\u2019t click overnight. Despite claims that there\u2019s a \u201cmagic number\u201d of days it takes to form a habit, my collaborators and I have disproven this myth in our recent research. We all form habits at our own speed, but for simpler and frequently repeated behaviors such as hand sanitizing, we can expect speedier habit formation than for more complex behaviors such as hitting the gym, which, on average, can take months rather than weeks to put on autopilot.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2021-11-29T09:39:54Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922081456-sevastopol-vpx.jpg?c=original", "title": "Ukraine launches missile attack on Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Crimea, officials say", "content": "Ukraine launched a missile attack on the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet on Friday, the latest and perhaps one of the most ambitious of Kyiv\u2019s recent strikes on Russian military targets in Crimea. \u201cThe enemy launched a missile attack on the headquarters of the fleet,\u201d Sevastopol\u2019s Russian-appointed governor Mikhail Razvozhayev said on Telegram.  Over the past month, Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian military bases and other installations, including air defenses, in Crimea. Sevastopol, home to Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet headquarters, is one of the largest cities on the Crimean peninsula and was illegally annexed by Moscow\u2019s forces in 2014. Russian\u2019s Ministry of Defense (MOD) said a Russian soldier was missing after the missile attack. The ministry had previously put out a statement that the soldier was killed as a result of the attack. They clarified in an updated statement that the soldier is missing, not killed.   \u201cThis afternoon the Kyiv regime launched a missile strike on the city of Sevastopol,\u201d the MOD posted on Telegram. \u201cWhile repelling a missile attack, five missiles were shot down by air defense systems. As a result of the attack, the historical headquarters building of the Black Sea Fleet was damaged. According to available information, one soldier was killed,\u201d the MOD stated.  Russian state media TASS reported that debris was \u201cscattered for hundreds of meters\u201d following the missile strike. TASS added that a large number of ambulances were on their way to the scene of the attack. Razvozhayev also said a piece of shrapnel fell near the Lunacharsky Theater.   The Russian-appointed governor said operational services went to the scene of the attack and that information about any casualties is being clarified.  In an update later Friday, Razvozhayev said there was no more \u201cmissile and aviation danger\u201d following the incident and said nobody was injured. The attack shattered windows in 10 residential buildings in the city, according to Razvozhayev. He added that gas and electricity supplies have been switched off, with water supplies also reduced, due to fires in the area. The Ukrainian Armed Forces\u2019 Strategic Communications Department confirmed on Friday that the country \u201cinflicted a successful hit\u201d on the headquarters of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol around noon local time.  A Ukrainian military spokesperson commented on the situation in the Black Sea, saying it remains \u201ctense\u201d and that Ukraine still has \u201ca long way to go\u201d to \u201cdestroy all the enemy\u2019s capabilities\u201d in Crimea. Russia is \u201crealizing that it is no longer safe for them in the Black Sea and in their bases,\u201d said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokesperson for the Security and Defense Forces of the South of Ukraine. In a video address, Humeniuk also said that \u201cexplosion season\u201d will continue. Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksii Danilov warned that the Russian Black Sea Fleet could be \u201csliced up like a salami\u201d in potential future strikes on Russia\u2019s military infrastructure.   Over the past month, Ukraine has stepped up attacks on Russian military bases and other installations, including air defenses, in Crimea. The latest attack came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky continued his North American tour; later Friday he was due to address Canada\u2019s parliament. On Wednesday, Ukraine Defense Intelligence spokesman, Andrii Yusov, told Ukrainian television that \u201cCrimea is still being used as a logistics hub for, among other things, the transfer of enemy forces and means to other parts of the front,\u201d and stated that \u201cin order to destroy this logistics hub, certain operations are being used and implemented: at sea, on land, and in the air.\u201d Friday\u2019s attack shows the vulnerability of critically important infrastructure on the peninsula. In short order, the Ukrainians have hit a Russian military airfield at Saki, degraded Russian air defenses on the north-west coast (including taking out an S-400 complex), and carried out a missile attack on the main dry-dock and ship-repair facility in Sevastopol, crippling an attack submarine and a landing ship.  The attack on Saki Thursday caused unspecified but \u201cserious damage\u201d at the airfield, according to SBU sources. There are plenty of reasons for Ukraine to target Crimea. It\u2019s politically a sign that despite the slow progress on the front lines Ukraine can still inflict serious damage on the Russian military. Targets such as the Crimea bridge have considerable symbolic value as well as strategic purpose. It\u2019s also part of a broader effort \u2013 in Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 to hit Russian logistics, fuel, maintenance and command centers \u2013 to disrupt their ability to supply the front lines.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T11:24:52Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922133446-02-sevastopol-smoke-092223.jpg?c=original", "title": "The counteroffensive may be flagging, but Crimea attack shows Ukraine can still inflict serious damage on the Russian military", "content": "The Ukrainian missile attack on the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet is perhaps the most dramatic example yet of the confidence with which Ukraine is going after Russian facilities in occupied Crimea \u2013 and the vulnerability of critically important infrastructure on the peninsula.

The attack on Saky on Thursday caused unspecified but \u201cserious damage\u201d at the airfield, according to sources in Ukraine\u2019s Security Services (SBU). On Wednesday, a large plume of smoke rose from a naval base near Sevastopol. Local authorities played down the incident, saying that a number of drones were brought down. But the Ukrainian military says it successfully hit a Russian command post near Verkhniosadove, a few kilometers from Sevastopol.  The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted that satellite imagery confirmed that Ukrainian forces \u201cstruck the 744th Communications Center of the Command of the Black Sea Fleet\u2026 as part of an apparent Ukrainian effort to target Black Sea Fleet facilities.\u201d   Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said a Russian soldier was missing after Friday\u2019s missile attack on the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. \u201cWhile repelling a missile attack, five missiles were shot down by air defense systems. As a result of the attack, the historical headquarters building of the Black Sea Fleet was damaged,\u201d the ministry said. Ukrainian Defense Intelligence spokesperson Andrii Yusov said Russia was using Crimea as a \u201clogistics hub\u201d and that \u201cthe ultimate goal, of course, is the de-occupation of Ukrainian Crimea.\u201d  Last month, Ukraine\u2019s special forces carried out a commando raid on the Crimean coast. The seizure earlier this month of oil platforms in the Black Sea by Ukrainian commandos has given them another jumping-off point and affected the Russian Black Sea fleet\u2019s freedom of navigation. The platforms, known as the Boyko Towers, had been controlled by Russia since soon after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.   There are plenty of reasons for Ukraine to target Crimea. It\u2019s politically a sign that despite the slow progress on the front lines in its counteroffensive, Ukraine can still inflict serious damage on the Russian military. Targets such as the Crimea bridge have considerable symbolic value as well as strategic purpose. It\u2019s also part of a broader effort \u2013 in Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 to hit Russian logistics, fuel, maintenance and command centers, in order to disrupt their ability to supply the front lines.  The Russian Black Sea Fleet has been involved in hundreds of cruise missile attacks against Ukraine and threatens merchant shipping using Ukrainian ports. Any disruption to its operation and command facilities (as well as the targeting of vessels at sea and in dock) is a win, especially after the Russian withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July. And, this week, the Ukrainians went after a drone facility in Crimea. Russia has used drones to target Ukraine\u2019s Danube River ports.  Ukraine has devoted considerable effort to degrading Russian air defenses in Crimea. That effort now appears to be paying off \u2013 as Ukrainian Neptune missiles (and most probably UK-provided Storm Shadows) are capable of reaching targets deep inside Crimea.   The Ukrainians appear also to have rejected or ignored criticism from some US officials of their concentration on Crimea. One unnamed senior US defense official told CNN recently that \u201cit\u2019s knocked the Russians off balance a bit, but it is not doing anything decisive\u2026 And it would probably be better for everyone for them to just focus on the counteroffensive.\u201d The Ukrainians argue with some justification that targeting anything to do with the Black Sea Fleet is worthwhile. As the ISW noted Thursday, \u201celements of the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade are engaged in critical defensive operations in western Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s 22nd Army Corps is defending positions on the east bank of Kherson Oblast.\u201d  It\u2019s worth remembering that the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s control of the Saky airfield gives it charge of ground-based aircraft in addition to its naval-based assets. The Black Sea Fleet is still a powerful element of Russia\u2019s offensive capability, but becoming less so by the week.   \u201cThe Black Sea Fleet is more than its naval assets, and the Ukrainian attacks on the Black Sea Fleet will likely achieve effects beyond the degradation of Russian naval capabilities,\u201d concludes the ISW.

He did not offer further details on the injuries, but said they have been transported to six area hospitals. Earlier, an official with the Wawayanda Fire Company told CNN more than 40 people were injured in the accident. \u201cPreliminary information indicates a failure of a front tire may have been a contributing factor to this accident,\u201d Mazzone added. A probe into the crash remains ongoing. Authorities responded to the crash at about 1:12 p.m. Thursday, Hochul said. \u201cImagine the fear, the screams and the aftermath when these high school students \u2013 many of them freshmen \u2013 were surrounded by this chaos,\u201d Hochul said. With the help of first responders and rescuers, the students were removed from the bus and brought to safety within 45 minutes, the governor added.  The bus was headed to a music event for band camp, a spokesperson from the high school confirmed to CNN. They were on their way to Greeley, Pennsylvania, the school said in a statement. \u201cWe were informed that there had been an accident with Bus 1 en route to Greeley, PA for band camp,\u201d Farmingdale High School spokesperson Jake Mendlinger told CNN. \u201cPolice and emergency responders are on the scene, as well as district administration.\u201d The bus was one of six headed to a band camp event in Pennsylvania, the Farmingdale School District said in a statement Thursday afternoon.

Wes Moore told CNN in an interview.  The vice president has faced renewed calls from some pundits and columnists to be dropped from the ticket amid heightened concerns about the president\u2019s age and doubts over her ability to lead if Biden were no longer able.   It\u2019s at least the second major go-around of questioning whether Harris\u2019 rightful place is by Biden\u2019s side for the 2024 contentious race, leaving her office tired of the fraught conversation, according to a person familiar with the dynamic. \u201cEverybody\u2019s sort of over it,\u201d the person said. The feeling is shared across most of the Democratic spectrum, who hope the party turns their sights on former President Donald Trump or whomever the Republican presidential nominee will be, instead of handwringing about themselves. A source close to the Biden campaign told CNN: \u201cPeople need to get on board and recognize every time they undermine the vice president, they undermine the campaign. We cannot afford to lose to these Republicans. So, get on board.\u201d There have both been private and public efforts to deliver this message. Privately, according to a person familiar with campaign operations, the Biden campaign contacted both former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, after neither directly answer repeated questions from CNN about whether Harris was the best running mate for Biden on the 2024 ticket. The campaign asked Pelosi and Raskin to clarify their comments and both lawmakers later cleaned up their remarks to offer direct messages of support. Raskin told CNN in a follow-up statement Friday that \u201cVice President Harris has excelled in perhaps the most ambiguous and challenging job in our constitutional system and she is unquestionably the best running mate for President Biden in 2024.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s office offered no additional statement but pointed CNN to the praise Pelosi heaped on Harris in her interview, saying she\u2019s \u201cvery politically astute, I don\u2019t think people give her enough credit.\u201d Discussions on how best to shepherd the party along are also happening among groups like the Congressional Black Caucus, who are actively talking about how to combat the replacement chatter and other attacks against the vice president, according to a source familiar with the effort.  \u201cSome of us need to say that they are acting in many ways like agents for the MAGA crowd,\u201d Rev. Al Sharpton told CNN. He plans to call on Democrats to stop during CBC weekend in Washington, DC.  \u201cI can only think that they are either politically stupid or working for the opposition.\u201d And according to conversations with more than a dozen Democratic strategists, elected officials and people close to the vice president, many will join Sharpton in urging Democrats to stop their groaning over the Biden-Harris ticket and end the chatter of potentially replacing the vice president.  Publicly, key Democrats have come out to support Harris, casting the lingering doubt as harmful to Biden and his 2024 chances. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said \u201cof course\u201d Harris should be the Democratic 2024 vice presidential nominee. Newsom and Harris are old friends \u2013 and sometimes frenemies. \u201cI mean, by definition, if I think this administration last two, two-and-a-half years, has been one of the most outstanding administrations the last few decades. And she\u2019s a member of that administration, she gets to lay and claim credit to a lot of that success. The answer is absolutely,\u201d he said in an interview to CNN earlier this week. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and a former rival who was once iced out by the vice president for her lukewarm support, said Thursday she was proud to support Harris\u2019 campaign with Biden. \u201cVice President Harris is a passionate, clear, unyielding advocate for Americans\u2019 freedoms, leading the administration\u2019s efforts to protect reproductive freedom and strengthen voting rights,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cI am proud to support her campaign with President Biden and I\u2019m confident that the Administration\u2019s record of delivering for American families will lead them to victory in 2024.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a lot of people in Washington who would love that job\u2019  Many who CNN spoke to believe the origins of the doubt come from a place of misogyny, racism or jealousy from other Democrats who wish they were in the vice president\u2019s spot. Harris is the first woman and first Black and South Asian person in her role. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people in Washington who would love that job,\u201d said Jim Messina, a Democratic operative who ran Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cI think that a lot of the criticism at the at the vice president is borderline misogynistic and there\u2019s a lot of people who judge her harder than they would judge a male politician (in) that role.\u201d Moore, the only Black governor in the US, said, \u201cThe attacks on her, they hit different \u2013 they hit our ears differently. And I think people should remember that.\u201d But others cite Harris\u2019 low poll numbers and history of gaffes as reasons to take a second look at her position. Three prominent political columnists collectively suggested politicians like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia as possibilities to replace Harris. Contacted by CNN, each Democrat rejected the notion. \u201cI absolutely do not think Vice President Harris should be dropped,\u201d Raimondo told CNN directly. \u201cI fully support Vice President Harris on the ticket. I think she is doing an incredible job as vice president and is a strong leader for our country.\u201d \u201cGov. Whitmer supports President Biden and Vice President Harris,\u201d a spokesperson for the Michigan governor responded. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve seen the vice president up close and in action in my state, and you couldn\u2019t contain the excitement in the room. I\u2019m hard-pressed to imagine a better partner for President Biden,\u201d Warnock told CNN.  \u201cKamala Harris is a tremendous leader. I was proud to introduce the Momnibus with her and am pleased we can continue to work together to end disparities in maternal health. I am on team Biden-Harris and enthusiastically support their re-election in 2024,\u201d Underwood said in a statement. \u201cAny assertion that there is anyone better qualified to run on the Democratic ticket other than President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris is absolutely ludicrous. I am excited to do my part to ensure that they are both re-elected so that we can continue delivering for the people of this country,\u201d Bass said in a statement. Harris keeps her head down  It\u2019s unclear whether the latest round of coalescing behind the vice president will be enough to stop all the handwringing.  Harris and the Biden administration have spent the last several months trying to build up her public profile, bolstering her public schedule to include stops focused on the hot 2024 issue of abortion as well as being the first-in-line responder to GOP attacks on freedom. On Thursday, the White House announced she would serve as the head a newly launched, first-of-its kind White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, the latest step in the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to enact meaningful gun control against the backdrop of a deadlocked Congress. Harris has also beefed up her fundraising efforts, a key signal of her expanded role in the campaign.  Biden aides see their path to victory next year embedded firmly in their ability to secure Black voters, women, young people and other groups that tend to respond warmly to Harris. But this most recent round of speculation comes as Republicans have frequently made Harris a central figure in their campaign trail attacks, with some \u2013 such as former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley \u2013 insinuating that this upcoming election is really about the vice president due to Biden\u2019s age. Asked earlier this month about her reaction to constant critiques, Harris said in an interview that it was \u201cnot new.\u201d \u201cThey feel the need to attack because they\u2019re scared that we will win based on the merit of the work that Joe Biden and I, and our administration, has done,\u201d she added. More recently, during a conversation at a Pennsylvania community college on voting rights, Harris did not directly reference the rumbles over her place on the ticket.

There was \u201crecord turnout, and it\u2019s because you voted that Joe Biden\u2019s president of the United States and I\u2019m vice president of the United States,\u201d she added to a crowd of younger voters.

And those close to Harris say, though she\u2019s generally \u201cvery aware of what people are saying,\u201d it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll proactively address the calls for her to leave the ticket.

Capote, a famous American writer and novelist, was born in New Orleans in 1924 and died in 1984. His two most famous works, \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d (1958) and \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d (1966), solidified his place among the great American authors of the 20th century. Now, the short story \u201cAnother Day in Paradise\u201d has been published Friday in \u201cThe Strand\u201d magazine after being discovered by its managing editor, Andrew F. Gulli, in Washington\u2019s Library of Congress. While Gulli had gone to the library to look for works by James M. Cain, the writer responsible for novels including \u201cThe Postman Always Rings Twice,\u201d he told CNN he also took the opportunity to search for Capote\u2019s work.  \u201cThen in a red notebook, there was a handwritten short story from Truman Capote. Actually I couldn\u2019t believe it, this can\u2019t be happening, because, you know, I was researching his work years ago, and I could not find it,\u201d he told CNN. The story is a \u2018day in the life\u2019 tale following unhappy American expat Iris Greentree, who finds herself living in Sicily after being persuaded to spend her life savings on a picturesque villa by a handsome man who later \u201cjilts\u201d her.  Gulli said that a \u201csmall army\u201d of people, including one of the executives at the Truman Capote Estate, helped to decipher the handwriting and transcribe the previously unknown work, which was written in pencil in \u201cvery challenging\u201d handwriting.  \u201cThese libraries have millions and millions of pages from all sorts of writers. So, you know, I can only guess that sometimes some of these things can just get missed,\u201d he explained.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like every single one is put in an envelope, or every single one has its place in a bookshelf \u2013 a lot of times it\u2019s a box, and there\u2019s a little portfolio. And sometimes, you know, a manuscript can kind of get lost in the whole process, or it can be cataloged incorrectly.\u201d \u201cThe Strand\u201d magazine specializes in lost works and has released writing by Ernest Hemmingway, John Steinbeck and H.G. Wells.  \u201cThe whole work of finding these unpublished works is something which I have to say is satisfying when it comes to fruition. But generally it\u2019s something very, very frustrating, because you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re always coming up with nothing,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWhat I found was fantastic was that the story is satisfying, finished, complete, it has his wry sense of humor.\u201d  The concept of the story, Gulli said, could be summed up as: \u201cYou could be living in some wonderful type of paradise, you can be living in a wonderful country, but a lot of times, if people aren\u2019t settled, the most wonderful setting on the planet can feel like a hell.

The European Union halted Russian seaborne imports of the fuel earlier this year as part of sanctions imposed on Moscow over Russia\u2019s full-scale invastion of Ukraine. But the EU still needs a steady flow of Russian diesel to global markets to keep prices stable. The Russian government announced the curbs \u2014 which also apply to gasoline \u2014 Thursday, saying they were aimed at stabilizing domestic fuel prices. The restrictions will stay in place for as long as the government deems necessary, Reuters reported Friday, citing a Kremlin spokesperson.  Diesel is Europe\u2019s economic workhorse, powering the majority of vans and trucks ferrying goods and raw materials round the continent. It\u2019s also a key heating fuel in some countries, and winter is approaching. Moscow\u2019s actions carry a wider economic threat, too \u2014 a possible uptick in inflation. Energy prices have already risen sharply in recent weeks, as Russia and Saudi Arabia have vowed to keep restricting crude oil supply until the end of the year. Russia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of diesel, accounting for over 13% of global supply so far this year, according to data firm Vortexa.  Since the introduction of the EU import ban in January, Moscow has found new buyers for its barrels in South America, the Middle East and North Africa. Analysts warn that a tightening of supply could ramp up global competition for the fuel in the months ahead, sending prices higher everywhere, including in Europe.  Tighter markets, higher prices Wholesale prices for European diesel jumped 5% Thursday, following the announcement of Russia\u2019s export curbs, to close at $1,020 per metric ton, data from Rystad Energy shows. Prices fell back to trade around $990 by Friday afternoon, still above their level before the news.  \u201cThe timing is really, really bad,\u201d Jorge Le\u00f3n, a senior vice-president at Rystad Energy, told CNN. \u201cSeasonally there is a lot of diesel demand in winter,\u201d he said, referring to its use in making heating oil to warm homes.  \u201cThere is a lot of construction and agriculture and manufacturing demand for diesel that picks up in the fourth quarter of the year,\u201d he added.   However, it is Russia\u2019s new customers outside of Europe that will be most hurt by the ban.  Pamela Munger, a senior market analyst at Vortexa, told CNN that Turkey had taken \u201chuge volumes\u201d of Russian diesel since the start of the year.  Before Europe imposed its import ban, Russia supplied 40% of the country\u2019s diesel. Over the past nine months, she said, that share has increased to 80%. The Kremlin\u2019s ban doesn\u2019t make \u201ca lot of sense\u201d for Russia economically, she said, given its status as the world\u2019s biggest supplier.  \u201cWhy would you ban what\u2019s bringing you so much income?\u201d she said.   Russia\u2019s latest energy salvo? Some analysts say the move may be the latest example of Moscow weaponizing its energy exports in retaliation for Western sanctions.  Henning Gloystein, a director at Eurasia Group, notes that the export limits have come \u201calmost exactly\u201d before Europe\u2019s heating season. While there is evidence of fuel shortages inside Russia, Gloystein says he struggles \u201cto believe that this a coincidence or purely a domestic issue.\u201d \u201cIt is no surprise that Russia is making another effort to inflict economic pain on the West as winter approaches,\u201d he told CNN.  Still, Gloystein expects the damage to Europe to be \u201cmuch more limited\u201d than that inflicted by Moscow\u2019s cuts to its natural gas exports last year.  \u201cGiven Europe has had one-and-a-half years to adjust to Russia\u2019s threats and supply cuts, the risk of energy shortages this winter are very low,\u201d he said.  But rising diesel prices coincide with a rally in prices for crude oil, fanning fears that inflation could surge again in Europe and the United States just as it has started to post significant falls.  The price of Brent crude, the global benchmark, has risen 30% since a low in late June mainly on the back of the  production cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia.  \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, we\u2019re seeing inflation gradually coming down,\u201d said Le\u00f3n at Rystad Energy.  \u201cIf there is a spike in diesel, which is widely used in Europe, that is going to mean an additional fueling of inflation in the months to come.\u201d  \u2014 Tim Lister and Anna Chernova contributed reporting.

It\u2019s been over three years since many restaurants closed their doors and customers opted to eat more meals at home because of the Covid pandemic. Now, some older customers are still staying away, exacerbating a foot traffic problem faced by restaurant chains. When it comes to customers over 65, \u201cwe just have not yet recovered the visits \u2026 to the extent we thought we would, really since the pandemic,\u201d said Cracker Barrel CEO Sandra Cochran during a call with analysts earlier this month. Older consumers have been hit by a double whammy, she said. At first, they stayed away because of health concerns. And then, they stayed away due to inflation.  \u201cThe over-65 group is particularly value-conscious,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we just haven\u2019t seen the recovery of that group.\u201d  The dip is coming at a time when Cracker Barrel\u2019s traffic is down across the board.  \u201cOur traffic declines were broad-based. They were against all of the age cohorts,\u201d Cochran said, but pointed out that \u201cthe younger cohort held up better than the over 65.\u201d Other chains, like Burger King, have also reported a dip in restaurant traffic as customers pull back due to higher prices.  Darden Restaurants (DRI), which owns Olive Garden, Longhorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen and others, noted during an analyst call Thursday that it, too, is seeing declining visits from older customers.  The customer group that is \u201c55-plus, especially 65-plus, is still below pre-Covid and actually a slight decline from last quarter to this quarter,\u201d said Darden CFO Raj Vennam during the call. Darden\u2019s traffic is down compared to pre-Covid levels, Vennam said.  Customers aged 65 and older \u201cwere a little bit more spooked on the Covid side,\u201d explained CEO Ricardo Cardenas. \u201cWe value all of our customers, including those over 65, and we\u2019d love to see them come back more frequently,\u201d he said.  But Darden, which is headquartered in Orlando, Florida, is also embracing the shift.  \u201cWe can use our eClub to talk to them and say, \u2018Hey, come back to Olive Garden,\u2019\u201d Cardenas said, referring to an online membership that offers customer perks. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to do some dramatic things because we\u2019ve actually seen a pretty big increase in our younger consumer.\u201d Sales at Darden restaurants open at least 16 months grew 5% to $2.7 billion in the quarter ending August 27, compared to the year before. The company reported other signs of health such as income holding steady at $195 million for the quarter and more than 100 new company-owned restaurants opening in the last year including 19 new Olive Garden restaurants for a total of 906 Olive Garden locations.  The largest of Darden\u2019s franchises by far, Olive Garden is about \u201cmore and more and more,\u201d as Cardenas said Thursday. \u201cCome in to Olive Garden for more, more food, more value, more refills.\u201d The company\u2019s share price has fluctuated since the pandemic and is up about 4% for the year but dipped about 2.5% on Thursday.  For Cracker Barrel, which has also been trying to attract younger consumers but has traditionally appealed to an older clientele, the pullback from older customers is a bigger deal.  At Cracker Barrel locations open for at least a year and a half, sales grew 2.4% from the year before in the three months ending July 28. But that was driven by higher prices. In retail, sales fell 6.8% compared to the year before. Cracker Barrel (CBRL) shares have also fluctuated during the pandemic and have fallen nearly 27% this year.  Based in Lebanon, Tennessee, Cracker Barrel operates 660 of its restaurants in 45 states, using an old country store motif to sell its brand of comfort food like biscuits and gravy.

The drugs were found Wednesday in the floor under a play area in the center after authorities got a search warrant to search the facility, the NYPD said. The drugs weighed roughly eight to 10 kilograms and were wrapped up in the form of bricks, according to a law enforcement official. Police said they also discovered other narcotics, though they did not specify what types, as well as drug paraphernalia. Photos released by the NYPD of the trap floor show what appears to be a wooden makeshift door opened and substances wrapped up in baggies in the floorboards.    A New York City grand jury voted Thursday to indict Grei Mendez, 36, and Carlisto Acevedo Brito, 41, two suspects in the deadly fentanyl overdose incident on September 15, according to Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark. \u201cA grand jury has returned a true bill, meaning that they\u2019re now indicted for various charges,\u201d Clark said. She did not specify what the charges were, noting the indictment was sealed but should be released publicly soon.

Three other children \u2013 two 2-year-old boys and an 8-month-old girl \u2013 were hospitalized after being exposed to the suspected fentanyl and suffered acute opioid intoxication, CNN previously reported.   Investigators said they discovered a kilogram of fentanyl in an area where children napped at the day care center.  \u201cMore evidence has been recovered that leads to the conclusion that this was more than just a day care center,\u201d Clark said Thursday. Mendez and Brito, along with other co-conspirators ran a fentanyl distribution business from the building where the day care is located, according to Damian Williams, a US Attorney for the Southern District of New York.   Investigators believe the suspects were midlevel drug distributors tasked with cutting fentanyl with other drugs or household items including baby powder, a federal law enforcement official said. Investigators say they are searching for a third male suspect who is believed to be Mendez\u2019s husband. The suspect, who has not been publicly named, appears on video leaving the center holding plastic bags detectives suspect contained fentanyl, authorities said. Attorneys for Mendez, who is the day care center\u2019s owner and operator, and Brito waived their clients\u2019 appearance in a hearing Thursday and said their clients would not testify before the grand jury. According to court documents, Brito is the cousin of Mendez\u2019s husband and a tenant who lives in a bedroom within the day care. A complaint filed in the Southern District of New York on Monday showed the suspects were federally charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death and possession with intent to distribute narcotics resulting in death. Both Mendez and Brito face up to life in prison on the federal charges.

Other federal employees, deemed \u201cessential,\u201d would need to work unpaid.  \u201cWe don\u2019t want the unpredictability that comes from a shutdown. It\u2019s not good for business \u2013 or consumer confidence,\u201d another trade group executive told CNN.  And some industries could feel the impact more directly, including travel.  A government shutdown would cost the US travel economy as much as $140 million a day, according to an analysis released this week by the US Travel Association. The trade group pointed to a survey finding that six in 10 Americans would cancel or avoid trips by air in the event of a shutdown. \u201cThis completely avoidable situation threatens livelihoods and jobs across the US economy,\u201d US Travel Association CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement. \u201cUltimately, travelers, businesses and workers will pay the price if lawmakers fail to enact a stop-gap funding bill.\u201d At the same time, a government shutdown would leave investors, economists and, most importantly, policymakers at the Federal Reserve flying blind, at least somewhat. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said a shutdown would delay the release of crucial data on inflation and unemployment. That would force Fed officials to make major decisions on interest rates by relying on private data.  Frustration with Republicans Publicly, business groups are urging Republicans and Democrats to come together to keep the government open.  Privately, there is growing frustration at Republicans as in-fighting within the House GOP spills out into the open.  \u201cThis is an issue that rests very much with the House GOP,\u201d one of the trade group executives said. There is also a sense that voters could blame Republicans for the mess. Asked what his message is to Republicans, Bradley, the Chamber executive, said it\u2019s \u201cno different\u201d than that of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who earlier this week warned shutdowns have \u201calways been a loser for Republicans politically.\u201d \u201cUsing a shutdown as a point of leverage has never worked historically,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cThere tends to be significant residual damage for whoever is perceived as instigating the shutdown.\u201d No matter who is blamed, some CEOs are frustrated with the polarizing environment in general.  \u201cThe inability to get anything done in Washington is having lots of negative implications,\u201d said Robbins, the Cisco CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s just irresponsible not to have a budget. We let politics get in the way of doing the core job, which is running the government and working for the people. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Markets usually don\u2019t care Wall Street is not overly worried about the potential damage to the economy at large nor the stock market. During the last shutdown, the record-long impasse that began in late 2018, stocks didn\u2019t just survive. They boomed. The S&P 500 surged 10.3% over the course of that 35-day shutdown. History shows the stock market has been flat on average during the 20 government shutdowns since 1976, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services. During half of those shutdowns, the stock market posted positive returns.  That \u201cmeh\u201d attitude from investors makes some sense: Unlike a potentially catastrophic debt default, a government shutdown would likely not deal a major hit to the national economy. Goldman Sachs recently told clients that the economic impact from a government shutdown would be \u201cmanageable,\u201d shrinking gross domestic product growth by about 0.2 percentage points per week. GDP growth would then recover by the same amount in the following quarter.  From fishermen to passports However, the Chamber of Commerce warned members in a memo this week that there would be significant micro disruptions, with everything from passports and permits to clinical trials and contractors getting caught in the middle. \u201cYou\u2019re measuring the wrong thing,\u201d Bradley said in reference to the GDP estimates highlighted by Goldman Sachs. \u201cThose of us who have been around government shutdowns in the past know there are real-world negative consequences.\u201d Bradley noted that during the last shutdown, there were commercial fisherman who couldn\u2019t get certificates for boats to go out and catch fish during the season and there were tourists who couldn\u2019t visit national parks and monuments.  \u201cThose are things that are time dependent and that you never get back,\u201d he said.

Her initiative was not only a photo opportunity, she also walked the walk: A few years later, her progressive government helped fund new lactation rooms at the UN headquarters in New York to make it easier for other new mothers to work. But women attending the annual top rendezvous of diplomacy have remained a minority, and the UN General Assembly this year is no different. Out of about 145 leaders set to speak, only ten women heads of state and governments are expected to address the assembly this year, alongside a few women foreign ministers.  \u201cThis perpetuates the cycle,\u201d Susana Malcorra, a former foreign minister of Argentina and president of Global Women Leaders Voices, said. \u201cThe number ten is about the magic number, in recent years it has gone up a little bit and then magically has come down again.\u201d Yet there has been one notable uptick over recent years \u2013 the number of female leaders representing the right side of the political spectrum, including Hungarian President Katalin Novak and this year\u2019s newcomer Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.  Meloni, leader of the far-right political party Brothers of Italy, has overseen the creation of new limits on the parental rights of same-sex couples, and has spoken out against abortion rights. On the international scene, however, she has often focused more widely palatable priorities, including support for Ukraine and Europe\u2019s migration crisis, calling on the UN to \u201cwage a global war\u201d on human traffickers.   \u201cMeloni has developed a reputation for being quite a safe pair of hands on the international scene,\u201d Richard Gowan, UN expert at the International Crisis Group, said, \u201cSo I don\u2019t actually think that she will be particularly disruptive in the [General Assembly] because her strategy has basically been to appear responsible on the world stage while pursuing a fairly a pretty more radical agenda at home.\u201d For Hungarian president Katalin Nov\u00e1k, a close ally of the country\u2019s hardline nationalist prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and another advocate for traditional \u201cfamily values\u201d, it\u2019s not her first visit to the UN. Last March, Nov\u00e1k spoke about the importance of preserving heterosexual families at the Commission on the Status of Women last March, the UN\u2019s annual meeting on women\u2019s rights. But she has also pushed back against some of her party\u2019s excesses, for example vetoing a bill might have encouraged citizens to report same-sex couples to authorities \u2013 a rare rebuff to Orban.  In her speech before the UN, Novak appeared to position population growth as even more important than the climate crisis: \u201cIf there is no child, there will be no future,\u201d she said:  \u201cWhat is the point of looking after the Earth if we don\u2019t have children and grandchildren to pass it on to?\u201d   Another potentially controversial first-timer is Dina Boluarte, Peru\u2019s first-ever woman president who took over from Pedro Castillo after his impeachment in December 2022. While she initially ran as a left-wing candidate, Boluarte has found allies in on Peru\u2019s right, and experts have expressed concern over Peruvian authorities\u2019 crackdown on political protest under her government.  Of course, not all the women leaders attending UNGA are on the far side of the political spectrum. On Wednesday, the GA heard from two women presidents leading two countries bordering Ukraine, Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 of Slovakia and Maia Sandu of Moldova, with Russia\u2019s war ravaging Ukraine a significant theme in their speeches. It was \u010caputov\u00e1\u2019s last General Assembly as president of her country, as she announced a few months ago she won\u2019t seek reelection in 2024 for personal reasons.  Slovenien president Nata\u0161a Pirc Musar also made her first UNGA appearance this week \u2013 an opportunity to set potential priorities for the country\u2019s term on the Security Council.  Slovenia was elected to the powerful council last June as a temporary member and is set to get its seat on the horseshoe table in January. One woman leader attending the UN General Assembly this year \u2013 and many others before \u2013 is Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh\u2019s prime minister and the longest-ever serving woman head of government in history. She first became prime minister in 1996 until 2001, and got the title back in 2009. The Bangladeshi leader is a familiar face in international affairs and a figure of stability to many. And wherever she goes, Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados rarely goes unnoticed. In previous years, she made the headlines by quoting Jamaican singer Bob Marley while on the rostrum, while asking for more meaningful action on climate and the Covid-19 pandemic. She comes to New York City while working on reforming international financial architecture \u2013 so her presence in the Big Apple is shaking things up.    Xiomara Castro, the leftist president of Honduras, is also in town for a second time to update the world on her work to fight corruption in her country.   And while they aren\u2019t taking the rostrum on behalf of their countries, there are several other powerful women leaders roaming the UN\u2019s corridors and undoubtedly leaving their mark on negotiations on UNGA\u2019s sidelines, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission; Kristalina Georgieva, the director of the International Monetary Fund; and Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the first woman to ever lead the World Trade Organization. Actress and philanthropist Natalie Portman is also in town for the event, wielding a different type of influence.

The messages, between Jonah Furman, Communications Director at the United Auto Workers Union, and other members of the labor community detail personal thoughts about the union\u2019s strategy against the Big Three. The comments broadly confirm what the UAW has publicly said already, and they lay out the union\u2019s willingness to use innovative measures to obtain the best possible deal for its workers. In one message, Furman wrote \u201cif we can keep them wounded for months, they don\u2019t know what to do\u2026 this is recurring reputations damage and operation chaos.\u201d In another, he writes \u201cThe beauty is we\u2019ve laid it all out in public and they\u2019re still helpless to stop it.\u201d Neither Jonah Furman, nor the UAW responded to requests for comment. Furman is not directly involved in negotiations with the Big Three. CNN reviewed a series of eight screen shots. The messages were part of a closed messaging group on X, formerly Twitter. The full context of the conversation is unknown, but the participants, who are in the labor community appear to be messaging about general union issues and strategy. The Detroit Free Press was the first to report the leaked messages. This is the UAW\u2019s first strike against all of the traditional \u201cBig Three\u201d automakers simultaneously. So far, the strike, which started early last Friday, has targeted only one final assembly plant at each automaker. But UAW President Shawn Fain announced Monday night that it would pick other plants if there is no \u201csubstantial progress\u201d in the offers from the automakers. The union has consistently spoken publicly about its use of new tactics, referring to the ongoing strike as a \u201cStand-Up Strike,\u201d which hearkens back to the original \u201cSit-Down Strike\u201d that was formative in the early years of the UAW. Whereas in years past, the UAW would only strike on automaker at a time, shutting it down entirely, during this negotiation the UAW is looking for maximum flexibility, with the ability to call local union leaders and shut down or re-start individual plants at a moment\u2019s notice.  Unions also typically make plans and preparations for long strikes, even ones lasting months. One advantage for the union of a targeted strike is the potential to save resources and extend a possible strike. The union members who are on strike are eligible for $500 a week in strike benefits from the union\u2019s strike fund. If all 145,000 UAW members among the three automakers were to strike at the same time, it could cost the fund more than $70 million a week, draining the $825 million fund. With targeted strikes, it\u2019s possible that the companies will shut down operations and lay off members who are not technically on strike. That could make them eligible to receive state unemployment benefits rather than strike benefits, which could preserve the union\u2019s resources. But there are legal questions about qualifying for unemployment. Creating confusion Before the strike began, Fain told members that it would be important for members to stay on the job if their plant is not chosen for a strike to give union negotiators the greatest possible power at the bargaining table. \u201cThis is going to create confusion for the companies. It\u2019s going to turbo charge the power of our negotiators,\u201d he told members. \u201cI know there\u2019s a hunger to [have all members] go on strike. That may still happen. This was not done on a whim.\u201d Stellantis, which made an additional offer to the UAW this week said in a statement; \u201cThese reported comments made by the UAW Communications Director are incredibly disturbing and strongly indicate that the UAW\u2019s approach to these talks is not in the best interest of the workforce. We are disappointed that it appears our employees are being used as pawns in an agenda that is not intended to meet their needs.\u201d \u201cWe will not be distracted from our goal, to negotiate an agreement that rewards our employees for their contributions while creating a sustainable future for the company. We strongly encourage our employees to ask their union negotiators to share the details of our offer with them. John Hatline, who has worked at General Motors for 49 years and has seen his fair share of strikes, told CNN before the strikes began that he thought targeted strikes can work. \u201cWe have used targeted strategies in the past. They have proven effective in helping resolve our contract disputes,\u201d said Hatline, who works at GM\u2019s Factory Zero in Detroit, which builds all electric vehicles. \u201cIt saves depletion of our strike fund. Without a substantial strike fund our bargaining power is reduced. When you enter a contract dispute you have to be willing to last one day longer than the company. Or all our sacrificing is for naught.\u201d General Motors, which put a fifth offer on the table yesterday said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that the UAW leadership has always intended to cause months-long disruption, regardless of the harm it causes to its members and their communities. The leaked information calls into question who is actually in charge of UAW strategy and shows a callous disregard for the seriousness of what is at stake.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing, to say the least, given what is at stake for our employees, the companies and this region,\u201d said Mark Truby, Chief Communications Officer at Ford. \u201cFor our part, we will continue to work, day and night, bargaining in good faith, to reach an agreement that rewards our workforce and allows Ford to invest in a vibrant and growing future.\u201d  Despite this, talks continue this morning with Stellantis, Genal Motors, and Ford, according to a source with knowledge.

In a statement, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that changes Microsoft (MSFT) put forward \u2014 involving the sale of Activision\u2019s cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft, a competitor \u2014 could help ensure that the nascent cloud gaming industry remains competitive.  Microsoft (MSFT) announced the deal in early 2022, but it was blocked in April by the UK competition regulator. Regulators had worried that Microsoft\u2019s control over popular Activision (ATVI) titles, including \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d and others, might allow it to withhold that content from rival gaming platforms. Of particular concern was the deal\u2019s impact on newer cloud-based services that allow players to access game content over the internet without having to download game files to their devices first. Such services are offered by Microsoft, as well as Nvidia and Sony.  Microsoft\u2019s proposal would allow Ubisoft to sell access to Activision titles via streaming cloud services in addition to traditional retail channels, the CMA said.  The CMA added Microsoft\u2019s amended deal would be effective in \u201creplicating the role that Activision would have played in the market as an independent player.\u201d Consummating the deal would turn Microsoft into the third largest video game publisher in the world, after Tencent and Sony. Microsoft said it was \u201cencouraged by this positive development in the CMA\u2019s review process.\u201d \u201cWe presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA\u2019s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18 deadline,\u201d Microsoft President Brad Smith said.  Activision, which also makes \u201cOverwatch\u201d and \u201cCandy Crush,\u201d said the preliminary approval was great news for its future with Microsoft. Its shares gained 1.8% in early trading. The European Union waved the deal through in May after accepting Microsoft\u2019s commitments to license Activision\u2019s games to other platforms, the same remedies that Britain had rejected. The US Federal Trade Commission also opposes the deal, but it has failed to stop it. A federal judge ruled in July that the deal can close, a decision the FTC is appealing.  Equity analyst Sophie Lund-Yates at Hargreaves Lansdown said the loss of the cloud gaming rights was not an ideal concession for Microsoft to have to make, but it was necessary collateral if the deal were to be waved through. \u201cThis looks to be the final bump in the road,\u201d she said. The CMA said there were \u201cresidual concerns\u201d around the Ubisoft deal, but Microsoft has offered remedies to ensure the terms of the sale were enforceable by the regulator. It is now consulting on the remedies before making a final decision. \u2014 Reuters contributed to this article.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T08:36:45Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230920104501-17-first-republican-debate-0823-file.jpg?c=original", "title": "For GOP candidates, a shrinking field brings an uncomfortable truth ahead of next debate", "content": "The second Republican presidential debate in California next week will mark a new phase in the primary contest: Some candidates will start to feel a new level of pressure to drop out.  As of Thursday, six candidates have said they had qualified for the second debate, which will take place next Wednesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Two other candidates who participated in the first debate of the cycle \u2013 North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson \u2013 had not said they had qualified for the debate. The far and away front-runner in the primary, former President Donald Trump, is opting to skip the debate again and instead do a prime time speech with current and former union members in Detroit.  For those on stage, the theme of the debate is resiliency, especially as a shrinking field increasingly becomes the uncomfortable truth. Even though Trump did not participate in the first debate, poll after poll since then has shown him with a dominant lead in the primary.  \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how the Republican world is looking at this debate \u2013 it\u2019s a winnow-the-field moment,\u201d Republican strategist Cam Savage said. \u201cNow obviously it will be somewhat winnowed (compared) to the last one just based on the conditions of entrants, but that\u2019s not really what people are talking about. What people are talking about is \u2018are any of these candidates going to break out and how is the field going to winnow?\u2019\u201d Going into the first debate, the lesser-known candidates were hoping for a breakout moment and the windfall of attention and donations that usually comes with it. Ramaswamy and Haley, in particular, have been enjoying the polling bumps and donations that come with a standout performance. But it\u2019s clear that staying in the primary will only get harder.  The criteria for even qualifying for the second debate are more restrictive. For a candidate to get on the debate stage, they need to have signed a pledge promising to back the eventual nominee of the 2024 Republican primary, hit 50,000 unique donors (a 10,000-donor increase from the first debate requirement) that includes a minimum 200 donors from 20 states and territories. Qualifying candidates also have to register at 3% in two national polls or the same level of support in one national poll and two polls from separate early nominating states \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada. The deadline for candidates to qualify for the second debate is Monday night. But beyond qualifying for the debate, strategists warn the window is closing for candidates to emerge as a Trump alternative, even those who continue to qualify for future debates. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say oxygen is running out but obviously the clock is ticking. Obviously we\u2019re moving closer to January,\u201d said Republican strategist Jay Williams, a nod to when the Iowa Republican caucuses are set to take place. Trump\u2019s rivals have been sharpening their attacks on the former president, seeking to contrast the president as unfit for the moment or out of step with the party on abortion. Those attacks haven\u2019t made much of a dent thus far into Trump\u2019s massive lead over the rest of the field. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean his lead will continue after this debate, but as time shrinks before the Iowa caucuses, it\u2019s apparent among candidates and strategists that time is running out in a less than ideal way for anyone besides Trump.  \u201cFormer President Trump continues to hold his position very firmly as the front-runner on the GOP side,\u201d Republican strategist James Hartman said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that rules out potential surges from a select few of the remaining candidates.\u201d Most of the contenders, after the first debate, have needed to consider whether they wanted to keep throwing money at bids that may not pan out, he noted. \u201cBut I think some of them still have potential,\u201d he said. Candidates are quick to admit the importance of being on the debate stage and the longterm consequences of being absent from it, including for Trump. While campaigning in New Hampshire on Thursday, Haley said it was a \u201cmistake\u201d for Trump to have skipped the first debate and dinged him for planning to also take a pass on the second one.  \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna be on the second debate stage,\u201d Haley said in Greenland, New Hampshire. \u201cI think that\u2019s gonna hurt him. You can\u2019t win the American people by being absent. You just can\u2019t. The American people want you to fight for them.\u201d Haley added, \u201cYou can\u2019t just not be on the debate stage because you\u2019re so high in the polls. You\u2019ve got to show not what you did in the last four years, what are you gonna do in the next four.\u201d  The real danger for the candidates is to have a \u201cbacksliding\u201d moment, Savage argued. DeSantis, for instance, can\u2019t afford to hover in the background of the debate as he did last time.  \u201cI think there\u2019s a sense that in these high stakes debates, you\u2019re only as good as your last performance, so if anybody has a backsliding moment that could be the end for them,\u201d Savage said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t think holding back if you\u2019re not DeSantis does you no good. He\u2019s more or less in second place despite the one poll that had Haley moving up. But in terms of the on-the-ground in the early states, it seems like DeSantis is perfectly in second place, so if you\u2019re not moving in that direction after this, the pressure is only going to build.\u201d Among the sect of the Republican voters and donors who don\u2019t want to back Trump in 2024, there has been a hesitance to weigh in on the primary until a consensus alternative has emerged. So far, that hasn\u2019t happened. Savage said it\u2019s not clear that, even if one candidate does break out from the non-Trump pack, it will matter in the end.  \u201cThe one thing that\u2019s yet to be determined, and maybe it doesn\u2019t matter at all, is if there\u2019s consolidation of support, can that give strength and momentum to one of these candidates to make a real run at Trump. And if there\u2019s not that consolidation, then all you\u2019re doing is waiting on pins and needles to see if someone can beat him by three points in Iowa in January,\u201d Savage said. \u201cThere\u2019s five or six candidates. Nobody\u2019s going to break away from it.

It\u2019s not the first time the government has been on the brink of a shutdown. The government shut down for 35 days, a record length, from December 2018 to January 2019 amid a congressional stalemate over funding for then-President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall.

The Republican leader slammed his far-right flank for wanting to \u201cburn the place down,\u201d after conservatives dramatically bucked McCarthy and GOP leadership on a procedural vote over a Pentagon funding bill, throwing the House into total paralysis. And now, members are not set to return to session until Tuesday as the possibility of a shutdown at the end of next week appears ever more likely.  \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating in the sense that I don\u2019t understand why anybody votes against bringing the idea and having the debate,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. Thursday\u2019s failed vote marked yet another blow to McCarthy, who is under pressure and has faced threats of an ouster. The defense funding bill that was derailed typically garners widespread bipartisan support, a sign of how even usually uncontroversial issues have become mired down in Republican infighting. Days of negotiations have yielded a few apparent breakthroughs, but the speaker\u2019s Republican opponents have been quick to throw cold water on progress and openly defy his calls for unity. McCarthy\u2019s thin margin in the chamber means that in most votes he can only lose four members without any support from Democrats \u2013 and absences can raise and lower the majority threshold.  House Republicans had originally planned to be in session over the weekend to pass a stop-gap government funding bill. But that strategy is now on ice amid infighting within the House GOP conference, and House Republican leaders are sending members home for the week amid deep divisions, according to multiple GOP sources. The new plan, according to multiple lawmakers and aides, is for Republicans to try to complete work on individual, long-term spending bills, since their short-term funding bill did not have the necessary GOP votes amid hardliner opposition. But there is little chance that work could be finished before next week\u2019s funding expiration deadline. In addition, those bills would be dead on arrival in the Senate, making that not a viable plan to avert a shutdown.  While votes are no longer expected over the weekend, some House lawmakers will remain in Washington to continue discussions over next steps.  Late Wednesday evening, McCarthy briefed his conference behind closed doors on a new potential plan to keep the government open \u2013 paired with deeper spending cuts and new border security measures \u2013 in an attempt to win over wary members on his right flank.  The plan, as outlined by the speaker, would keep the government open for 30 days at a $1.47 trillion spending level, a commission to address the debt and a border security package. Separately, they also agreed to move year-long funding bills at a $1.53 trillion level. That level is below the bipartisan agreement that the speaker reached with the White House to raise the national debt limit. It\u2019s not clear whether Republicans would actually be able to unify around the plan \u2013 but even if they did, it would be on arrival in the Senate, making it not viable as an option to actually prevent a shutdown.  On Thursday, six Republicans total ended up voting against the rule. Reps. Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Matt Rosendale of Montana, Eli Crane of Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia voted against the bill. House Rules Committee Chairman Tom Cole of Oklahoma also eventually changed his vote, casting his vote against the rule so he could bring it back up for reconsideration.  It remains unclear exactly what course of action Congress will take next week as it rapidly approaches the shutdown deadline.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, took a procedural step on Thursday that would allow the Senate to vote on a short term government funding bill next week.  \u201cAs I have said for months, we must work in a bipartisan fashion to keep our government open, avoid a shutdown and avoid inflicting unnecessary pain on the American people. This action will give the Senate the option to do just that,\u201d he said.

The world of streaming, however, favors the long winded, a factor much in evidence in \u201cThe Continental: From the World of John Wick,\u201d a handsomely produced but unnecessary prequel Peacock miniseries with a Keanu Reeves-shaped donut hole. Set in the 1970s, the three-part project (the time commitment that suggests is a bit misleading, since each chapter running well over an hour) derives its biggest kick from the very savvily selected period song score, nicely setting the mood of a gritty, shadowy New York during the disco years. Frankly, those songs, like Donna Summer\u2019s \u201cI Feel Love,\u201d do as much as the Wick-style fight sequences to make \u201cThe Continental\u201d worth a visit, if not a full stay. The highest hurdle likely involves the plot, which focuses on the history of the hotel haven for assassins, the mysterious organization known as the High Table and hotel proprietor Winston Scott (Ian McShane in the movies), played here by Colin Woodell. This younger version of Winston is essentially minding his own business, trying to make it as an entrepreneur, when his battle-hardened brother Frankie (Ben Robson) steals something from the High Table, prompting an extended, densely choreographed fight of the punch/shoot-twice variety. Desperate to find Frankie, the High Table and the Continental\u2019s owner Cormac, played by Mel Gibson, abducts him. Gibson gives the show its one bit of identifiable star power, with the tradeoff being his strangely accented, over-the-top performance is distractingly bad. Facing such formidable adversaries, Winston needs allies. He gradually finds them, but all the story-driven shenanigans involved in assembling them feel a little too much like killing time before getting to the next action sequence, which, let\u2019s face it, is the main attraction. Indeed, there\u2019s not much sense the wider Wick \u201cworld\u201d holds that much fascination, and while the show does produce some intriguing characters \u2013 perhaps the best being Yen (Nhung Kate), whose first impulse in almost every dangerous situation is to punch her way out of it \u2013 \u201cJohn Wick\u2019s\u201d supporting players, including the recognizable names such as Charon (the late Lance Reddick in the four movies, and Ayomide Adegun here) don\u2019t amass enough screen time to stoke much demand for an origin story. A fight with a contortionist does add a novel twist to things (literally), and the decision to deploy the hotel\u2019s \u201cweirdos\u201d to pursue Winston, along with an homage to \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d offers a sense of the show\u2019s playful, almost eccentric edge. Premium-TV standards also apply to the language, violence and sex, the last a pastime for which the movies understandably haven\u2019t had much time. Yet despite no shortage of action, \u201cThe Continental\u201d finally feels short on firepower. Granted, for a streaming service like Peacock (which will spread the show over three successive weeks), just the chance to draft off the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d name is surely a no-brainer, even if this period piece is a relatively big-ticket item. After checking out the accommodations, though, whatever curiosity and novelty that might \u201cThe Continental\u201d have held soon fades, making the prospect of booking future reservations one that Peacock, for the time being, should likely put on hold.  \u201cThe Continental: From the World of John Wick\u201d premieres September 22 on Peacock.

We\u2019re going to have support staff there.\u201d Hawaiian authorities prohibited public entry to Lahaina after wildfires tore through the town and surrounding areas in August, reducing the culturally rich community and many of its historic landmarks to rubble and ash. As about 100 people died in the Maui fires, many have still not returned to the land where their loved ones were lost.  The disaster area has been split into zones, which will be gradually reopened to residents as they are inspected and deemed safe to reenter, according to Maui officials. Residents of the first zone to be cleared for reentry on Monday \u2013 a northern section of Lahaina around Kaniau Road \u2013 will be offered support and resources, including water, transportation, medical and mental health care and language assistance, Maui officials announced.  \u201cSome people will only want to go for a very short period of time, a few minutes, to say goodbye in a way to their property. Others may want to stay several hours,\u201d Green said.

County officials are urging residents to be aware of the health risks of trying to \u201cclean up\u201d their burned properties and are warning against improperly handling debris and ash, which could cause wider harm if it becomes airborne.

The 2010 movie essentially created as a sort of full-employment act for an older contingent of action stars. Given the meta aspects of that in Hollywood \u2013 where aging is almost as dangerous as mercenary work career-wise \u2013 the franchise had a semi-refreshing feel, never mind its limited commitment to little matters like plot and story. Yet even allowing for that, they could have tried a little harder than this. Streamlined to the point of simple-mindedness, the set-up involves a ruthless bad guy (Iko Uwais) who steals a nuclear weapon, forcing everyone\u2019s favorite team of old warhorses to saddle up again, this time with marching orders from a government operative played by Andy Garcia. Although Barney (Sylvester Stallone) is still the gnarled leader of the group, there\u2019s a fair amount of buddy bonding from the top between him and Lee (Jason Statham), in what amounts to a baton pass in terms of Statham taking point as the centerpiece of the action, having already spent the summer fighting giant prehistoric sharks in \u201cThe Meg\u201d sequel. Lee also has a girlfriend, Gina (Megan Fox), who is every bit as deadly as he is, skills that the two use as a form of foreplay.

Paul Dano heads a sprawling cast as the guy leading the rebels with pitchforks on behalf of GameStop, resulting in a film that\u2019s smart and satisfying enough to earn every dollar it makes. Adopting a whimsical tone similar to Netflix\u2019s docuseries \u201cEat the Rich: The GameStop Saga,\u201d director Craig Gillespie (whose nice touch with quirky fact-based stories includes \u201cI, Tonya\u201d) follows these events through the eyes of a dizzying number of players, including uber-rich hedge-fund managers \u2013 who initially laughed off the threat \u2013 and various people who bought GameStop stock, driving up the price while playing a dangerous game as to when or whether to cash in their paper wealth. At the forefront of that stood Keith Gill (Dano), a.k.a. Roaring Kitty, a former trader whose online advice via YouTube and Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets ran counter to the \u201csmart money\u201d regarding GameStop, as embodied by Melvin Capital\u2019s Gabe Plotkin (Seth Rogen), who had heavily shorted, or bet against, the stock. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s one guy driving all the buying,\u201d the hedge-fund types snicker, only to watch those smug smiles fade as GameStop stock keeps soaring and their losses mount. Written by Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo from Ben Mezrich\u2019s book, the movie feels a little too busy and frenetic at first, before gradually settling into its groove amid the interlocking tales, each told with a running on-screen tally of the character\u2019s net worth: Gill and his family, including Shailene Woodley as his wife and Pete Davidson as his slacker bong-hitting brother; America Ferrera as a nurse/single mom; Antonio Ramos as a GameStop employee; Talia Ryder and Myha\u2019la Harold as a pair of students who begin investing; Sebastian Stan as Robinhood co-founder Vlad Tenev; and Nick Offerman as the billionaire CEO of Citadel. While there\u2019s clearly some fudging and composite characters in the narrative, Gillespie deftly weaves in footage from business-news channels to lend authenticity to the proceedings, as well as a clip from Stephen Colbert\u2019s show that neatly sums up the forces at play here. The film derives its anchor, though, from Dano\u2019s relatable portrait of an ordinary guy from a working-class Massachusetts town who took on the investing elite and made them look stupid. (As a footnote, he\u2019s reunited with Rogen after Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cThe Fabelmans,\u201d although in terms of who\u2019s taking from whom, the roles are somewhat reversed.)

Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s 2021 win ended a multiyear Democratic streak of statewide victories. Those wins were largely fueled by the party\u2019s gains in the commonwealth\u2019s northern suburbs outside Washington, DC.  Youngkin, whose political action committee raised $12 million between March and August of this year, would see his political ambitions buoyed if the GOP keeps its state House majority and flips the narrow Democratic edge in the state Senate, giving Republicans full control of state government.  The election could also decide the future of abortion access in Virginia \u2013 the only Southern state that hasn\u2019t imposed new restrictions on the procedure since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade last year. Youngkin has proposed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions for rape, incest and when the life of the mother is in jeopardy.  Democrats across the country have used the abortion issue to motivate their voters, turning in a stronger-than-expected showing in last year\u2019s midterm elections and then winning a key judicial race in Wisconsin this spring in which abortion was the central issue. And on post-Roe ballot initiatives across the country, voters have sided with the pro-abortion rights position, even in traditionally red states.  In another marquee election this fall, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky launched an ad this week hammering his GOP challenger, state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, over his opposition to abortion rights.  In Virginia, the most crucial territory in the battle for control of the state legislature could be the Richmond suburbs in Henrico County. Those include the state\u2019s 16th Senate District, where GOP Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, the only medical doctor in the legislature, faces Democratic Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg and the 57th state House District, where Democratic nurse practitioner Susanna Gibson and retired Republican homebuilder David Owen are vying for an open seat. Gibson has faced controversy in recent weeks after reports emerged that she and her husband had live-streamed sexual acts for tips on a pornographic website.  Both parties have made significant early-voting pushes in Virginia. Democrats launched a turnout operation they have dubbed \u201cThe Majority Project,\u201d which features 100 staffers organizing in key legislative districts.

They didn\u2019t expect an arduous process. She said they always easily landed loans, including a mortgage in 2009 in the wake of the US housing crisis.  At first, Magnusson, a teacher in Arizona who runs a consulting company with her husband, considered a home equity loan, sometimes called a second mortgage, because a borrower\u2019s home secures the loan. But after multiple brokers told her they no longer offered that type of loan, she turned to USAA, a financial services company for military veterans and their families, for a personal loan of $75,000 instead. Magnusson said that while she used USAA for a personal loan in the past, this time, the process felt very different. \u201cThey started asking for every document you could imagine,\u201d she said. That included tax returns and other financial documents back to 2020, even though, according to Magnusson, she and her husband have enough income to pay off the loan in less than one year. Magnusson\u2019s credit score is above 800, according to a screenshot she provided which was viewed by CNN.  Lately, it may take more than just a good credit score for many people to get approved for a loan. New research shows banks and other lenders have tightened their lending standards to an extraordinary degree in recent months. That means Americans not only have to search harder for a willing lender, they must also provide more documentation to get approved, making it more challenging to fund big-ticket purchases like cars, homes, and renovations. Loan rejections are up According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s June Survey of Consumer Expectations, the overall rejection rate for credit applicants increased to nearly 22%, the highest level since June 2018. Rejections jumped across the board, rising 14% for auto loans, 13% for mortgages, and nearly 31% for credit card limit increases. Deutsche Bank recently told investors that bank lending conditions look \u201cconsistent with recession levels,\u201d even though the US is not currently in a recession.   While Magnusson and her husband ultimately secured the loan from USAA with an interest rate of 10% to renovate their kitchen in July, USAA required the couple to provide more than 20 financial documents to gain approval, she said. Magnusson said she was \u201cin tears\u201d after spending hours on the phone with USAA to secure the loan over multiple days. \u201cI was just dumbfounded,\u201d she said. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson for USAA said it has streamlined its consumer loan process and 85% of decisions on unsecured loan applications in 2023 were made immediately.  \u201cOn select occasions, including some instances with large dollar requests, additional income verification may be required. Nearly half of the 15% of applications requiring manual support were processed the same day they were received,\u201d the spokesperson said.  Higher interest rates are the culprit Greg McBride, Bankrate\u2019s Chief Financial Analyst said that the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate hiking campaign \u2014 the fastest in 40 years \u2014 is the primary reason banks and other lenders have gotten so strict about loans. As the Fed hikes its Federal Funds Rate, the rate that banks charge one another to borrow and lend their excess reserves, \u201cmoney costs more,\u201d McBride said.   McBride also said that while lending standards have been tightening for more than a year, the recent failures of regional banks, like Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, may have pushed standards to become even more strict. \u201cThat has led to the prospect of increased capital requirements for a larger swath of banks, not just the big banks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has accelerated the tightening of lending standards.\u201d Earlier this year, US bank regulators proposed a new rule that would increase the level of capital that banks with at least $100 billion in assets would be required to hold. According to McBride, those proposed rules have made some lenders more cautious about lending out money. But it\u2019s more than just the big banks that are tightening lending standards: some smaller lenders may be less likely to offer a loan than they would have in recent years, as well.  William Brown, who is retired from the Navy, said he recently faced difficulty securing a $7,000 increase on his credit card limit through his local, Florida-based credit union, Suncoast Credit Union. Brown has a credit score over 700, according to a screenshot he provided which was viewed by CNN.  Like Magnusson\u2019s experience, Suncoast asked Brown to provide more documents than he anticipated to gain approval, and the process took weeks, he said.  \u201cMy wife and I have never been declined anything we\u2019ve applied for ever,\u201d Brown said. Suncoast asked for multiple forms of proof of his Navy pension and two years of tax returns, he said.  \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced this. For buying a house, yes, but I\u2019ve never needed that much income proof for a car loan or anything like that,\u201d he said.  In a statement to CNN, Suncoast executive vice president Darlene Johnson said that Suncoast\u2019s underwriting positions have not changed because of interest rate increases but rising rates do impact payment calculations. \u201cThat means that elevated payments will increase a member\u2019s debt to income ratio which can potentially affect their ability to repay a loan and this is something all financial organizations consider when making underwriting decisions,\u201d Johnson said.   Time for a \u2018gut check?\u2019 Not only are application rejections up, but demand for loans has also dropped to \u201cclose to a historic low,\u201d according to an August analysis by Evercore. Data shows that fewer people are applying for mortgages, which is the largest debt most people undertake, for example.  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, mortgage applications are 26% lower this week than they were the same week last year. The decline in applications comes as mortgage rates remain above 7%.   Loans are a \u201cmuch costlier proposition\u201d today, McBride said. \u201cDo you want to pay more for something than you would have paid two years ago?\u201d While Magnusson and Brown were both ultimately approved for their loans, their interest rate payments are likely significantly higher than they likely would have been a few years ago when the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near historic lows. McBride said that although loan application rejections are up and standards are tougher, getting a loan is still possible for those with good credit. \u201cWhere it\u2019s most difficult are riskier borrowers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s less credit available, and what\u2019s available costs considerably more.\u201d McBride suggested now is a good time for potential borrowers to do a \u201cgut-check\u201d and decide whether borrowing money will \u201csolve your problem, make your problem worse, or just kick the can down the road.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T11:56:54Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921134312-wga-strike-0502.jpg?c=original", "title": "Writers and studios to meet for 3rd consecutive day after \u2018marathon\u2019 talks", "content": "The striking writers and Hollywood studios will meet for a third consecutive day Friday, after wrapping up \u201cmarathon\u201d negotiations aimed at ending the nearly 150-day standoff.  The Writers Guild of America said in a message to its members late Thursday that they urged members to return to the picket lines, even as the WGA union and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers studio bosses are set to return to negotiations.  \u201cThe WGA and AMPTP met for bargaining today and will meet again tomorrow,\u201d the guild wrote in a note sent to members late Thursday. \u201cYour Negotiating Committee appreciates all the messages of solidarity and support we have received the last few days, and ask as many of you as possible to come out to the picket lines tomorrow.\u201d The writers and heads of the four big Hollywood studios negotiated for more than 10 hours Thursday without reaching a deal, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.  The person, who requested anonymity because they were not publicly authorized to discuss the matter, said that more progress was made during the negotiations Thursday, the second straight day of intense talks between the two sides, but a deal still has not been inked to end the historic Hollywood work stoppage.  The AMPTP studio bosses \u2014 Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav, Disney chief Bob Iger, Netflix co-chief Ted Sarandos, and NBCUniversal studio chairman Donna Langley \u2014 resumed negotiations on Wednesday with the WGA. After the meeting, both sides issued a rare joint statement noting their discussions would continue the following day. The fact that the two sides \u2014 which at times have rebuked each other for comments to the media \u2014 issued a joint statement signaled a possible sign of progress. Warner Bros. Discovery is CNN\u2019s parent company. The WGA went on strike May 2 with the work stoppage reaching its 143rd day on Thursday, putting it within two weeks of the longest strike in the union\u2019s history, which lasted 154 days in 1988. Many productions had halted even before SAG-AFTRA joined the WGA on strike July 14. Both sides have similar sets of demands, including better wages, residuals payments from streaming services for their work, and job protections against the use of artificial intelligence. Fighting for the future of media Revenue streams from traditional linear television have been in decline, and streaming services \u2013 while growing \u2013 are losing money. Streaming shows tend to offer shorter seasons, reducing the amount of available work for writers. The writers have said they can\u2019t afford to live under the current economics and pay structure of the television and movie industry, with fewer job opportunities on many shows and lower pay for many writers who do find work. There are many successful, even award-winning, writers who are finding themselves unable to make a living at the profession anymore. Many productions also employ fewer writers than were on staff in the past. And the writers union wants writers to collect residuals on streaming shows and movies when the content is sold and re-aired. It\u2019s been an important source of income for many writers over the years. Today, they\u2019re unlikely to get meaningful residuals, if any at all, when they create original content for streaming services. Writers are also concerned about the rise of artificial intelligence and want protections to ensure movies and shows are written by humans, not machines. Studio management says they\u2019ve been trying to offer a deal that is beneficial to both sides, but that they can\u2019t afford to meet all of the union\u2019s demands, including minimum staffing levels and duration of employment when writers are hired. Even if the writers settle soon, most television and movie production can\u2019t resume right away. That\u2019s largely because the SAG-AFTRA actors union remains on strike, and a deal between actors and Hollywood has remained elusive. They don\u2019t have the same signs of progress in negotiations that the writers union has shown. - CNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed to this report", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T03:18:29Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230920122720-kelli-ritschel-boehle-lamp-cnnheroes.jpg?c=original", "title": "The Wish Maker: She makes dreams come true for hundreds of young adults battling cancer", "content": "Kelli Ritschel Boehle says her son Nik was an amazing and caring person.   \u201cBut I\u2019m sure every mom says the same thing about their children,\u201d she said.  Nik was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer in 2008 when he was 17. He passed away in the spring of 2012. But Nik\u2019s kindness and generosity have lived on long after his death. After he was diagnosed and started treatment, Nik was granted a wish experience from the Make-A-Wish Foundation. \u201cTo him, it was like the Willy Wonka golden ticket,\u201d Ritschel Boehle said. \u201cHe was always looking for the positive in this situation. He kept coming up with crazy wishes.\u201d Nik befriended his wish grantors and asked for things like a pet monkey or to appear on the game show \u201cDeal or No Deal\u201d before he landed on a vacation to Hawaii with his family so they could spend time away together.  \u201cFor just this period of time, we didn\u2019t think about cancer,\u201d Ritschel Boehle said. \u201cAll we thought about is, \u2018Here we are, together, happy, just enjoying our time together.\u2019 And it was beautiful.\u201d A year later, Nik met another young man going through cancer treatment. He\u2019d been diagnosed a month after turning 18, and Nik learned he was too old to qualify for a wish. That broke Nik\u2019s heart, Ritschel Boehle said; he wanted his friend to receive the same joy he had. The night before Nik passed away, he asked Ritschel Boehle to help make sure that young adults fighting cancer could have their wishes come true too.  \u201cIt was like a seed he planted that just wouldn\u2019t stop nagging at my mind until the point where it was waking me up in the middle of the night,\u201d she said. Granting \u2018Nik\u2019s Wish\u2019  In 2012, with the help of family and friends, Ritschel Boehle started Nik\u2019s Wish. The nonprofit grants wishes to young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 who are battling cancer. Nate, the 18-year-old Nik had met in treatment, was the organization\u2019s first wish recipient. He chose to visit his grandmother in California and have a family reunion. Today, the organization grants wishes that run the gamut. They have gifted gaming computers, concert tickets, meet and greet events with celebrities, and vacations. \u201cThe one thing in common is it has to bring them joy and know that they\u2019re loved and that we\u2019re fighting for them, too,\u201d Ritschel Boehle said.  In April, Abigail Savage, a 23-year-old who was battling terminal cancer, was surprised at her home by Ritschel Boehle and more than a dozen volunteers to let her know her wish was coming true. The group arrived with its 16-foot genie lamp sculpture in tow, built by Ritschel Boehle and her husband for wish deliveries. They carried signs and cheered, making sure Savage knew she had a team of people supporting her. \u201cThis was the biggest surprise of my whole life and the best biggest surprise,\u201d Savage told CNN. \u201cThe other biggest surprise was cancer. So, this beats that, like, by a lot.\u201d When Savage became too sick to travel by plane to Hawaii, her original wish, her experience was adjusted to something that ultimately became even more meaningful for her and her family. She was able to travel in an RV across the country to her hometown in Montana and visit family before she passed away last month. Savage had battled the disease for five years. \u201cI have obviously never known when my health is going to take a pivot,\u201d Savage said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to make these kind of memories with my family.\u201d Hundreds of wishes and counting  Once the recipient and their family learn that their wish is granted, a dedicated volunteer wish maker works closely with them, making all the arrangements. The goal is that all details are taken care of by the organization so they can just enjoy their wish experience and precious time together. In the beginning, Ritschel Boehle says she wasn\u2019t sure she could be a wish maker and work closely with the young adults \u2013 it was too painful for her to relive those memories of Nik. But now, it\u2019s her favorite thing to do.  \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t strong enough to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I recently helped my 100th person as a wish maker. I just love speaking with them and getting to know them.\u201d Recently, 19-year-old Jordan Morrow received her wish to attend a Taylor Swift concert as part of a trip to Los Angeles. \u201cWhen I walked into the first day of radiation, they asked me who my favorite singer was, and I said, \u2018Taylor Swift.\u2019 And they said, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll try to have some Taylor Swift music playing every day for you.\u2019\u201d Morrow said. \u201cShe got me through some hard times.\u201d For Morrow, who has spent the last year battling brain cancer, going to the concert and touring LA has done more than lift her spirits.   \u201cI think it\u2019s something to get me through whatever comes my way,\u201d she said.  \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful for Nik\u2019s Wish for that.\u201d In the 11 years since Nik passed away, the organization has granted more than 300 wishes across more than 30 states. But for Ritschel Boehle, the reason behind every wish remains the same.  \u201cI think he is looking down from heaven, telling me, \u2018I told you, Mom. We can do it. You can do it. They need it. Keep going,\u2019\u201d Ritschel Boehle said. \u201cI think he\u2019s always encouraging me, always helping me out.\u201d Want to get involved?

Here\u2019s what you need to know", "content": "Central bank officials around the world relayed a somewhat unified message this week to the global economy: Inflation is coming down, but the battle is far from won. Some of the world\u2019s most prominent monetary policy leaders announced their latest decisions in their respective fights against persistent inflation. Most held rates steady, taking a breather from a historic pace of interest rate hikes to stabilize skyrocketing prices. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what happened. United States: The Federal Reserve in September paused interest rates for the second time after first hitting the brakes in June. The central bank has hiked rates 11 times since last March. Its latest set of economic projections showed that more officials expect the Fed\u2019s key lending rate to reach a range of 5.63%-5.87% this year \u2014 in other words, the central bank could hike rates one more time by year\u2019s end. The Fed also expects fewer rate cuts next year than previously expected, and lifted its expectation of economic growth this year while slightly lowering its unemployment rate projection. \u201cMonetary policy might be close to where it needs to be, but the current inflation data shows that the conditions are not quite there,\u201d said Brian Henderson, chief investment officer at BOK Financial. United Kingdom: The Bank of England halted its rate hiking cycle on Thursday for the first time in nearly two years. That comes after inflation declined unexpectedly last month and keeps the main borrowing cost for UK commercial banks at its highest level since 2008. But the Bank of England didn\u2019t take future rate hikes off the table, stating that signs that inflation isn\u2019t abating further could lead to more increases. \u201cOdds are the bank is done here, with policymakers downplaying [average weekly earnings] wage data and putting the onus of proof on the data to justify more tightening,\u201d Evercore ISI strategists wrote in a note Thursday.  Switzerland: The Swiss National Bank left its policy rate unchanged at 1.75% on Thursday after five straight hikes but didn\u2019t rule out future rate hikes if prices don\u2019t continue to stabilize. What does it all mean? While central banks took steps to pause interest rates this week, they kept future hikes on the table.  That means that stubborn inflation is still a global problem despite the progress that\u2019s been made, says Nate Thooft, chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Manulife Investment Management. His firm has a slightly outsized allocation in US stocks, since both the economy and corporate earnings have held up so far this year, but is considering trimming some of its exposure later if the tide shifts. \u201cThere\u2019s a real likelihood to get some volatility where you might get some rolling corrections in the equity markets,\u201d said Thooft. TikTok was built off of Black creators. Black employees say they faced discrimination Nnete Matima said she was attracted to work at TikTok because of how the social media platform was \u201creally built upon Black culture\u201d and the work of Black creators, report my colleagues Catherine Thorbecke and Clare Duffy. She saw and welcomed TikTok\u2019s public pledge of support for the Black community in the wake of the 2020 police murder of George Floyd and applied to work for the company because she felt its corporate values \u201creally resonated with me,\u201d Matima told CNN. Shortly after she began working at TikTok-parent company ByteDance last year, however, she alleges she encountered \u201ctoxicity and racism\u201d in the workplace. Her manager would refer to her as a \u201cblack snake\u201d behind her back and set unrealistic and uneven expectations for her compared to her white peers, Matima claims.  The mistreatment only got worse, she said, after she spoke up about it via human resources channels. Read more here. US home prices continued to climb in August, even as sales dropped Home prices continued to climb in August, even as home sales dropped, according to a monthly report from the National Association of Realtors. That\u2019s a result of the low inventory of homes for sale pushing prices up and stubbornly high mortgage rates keeping buyers out of the market, reports my colleague Anna Bahney. The median price for existing homes \u2014 including single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops \u2014 was $407,100 last month. That was up 3.9% from a year ago when the median home price was $391,700. Prices rose in all four regions of the country, the Northeast, Midwest, South and the West, the NAR report found. The month before, in July, prices also went up, reversing five months of year-over-year declines.

Nessel, an Democrat, made the comments at a virtual event Monday that was hosted and promoted by liberal groups to discuss \u201cmessaging\u201d around the 2020 election cases involving Trump and his allies. Back in July, Nessel\u2019s office filed the first-of-their-kind criminal charges against the fake electors in Michigan.  \u201cPeople talk a lot about, oh, why don\u2019t you start flipping some of those people so that they can become witnesses against the remaining defendants, the worst-acting defendants?\u201d Nessel said. \u201cThe problem is, these are people who have been brainwashed.\u201d  She continued, \u201chow do you flip someone who concedes that they did everything that they\u2019re accused of doing, but what they say is, \u2018we believe that we were in the right. We think that Donald Trump is the real winner of the election\u2019 \u2026 They really legit believe that. They genuinely believe it. Somebody can\u2019t even plead guilty if they wanted to, because they can\u2019t admit that what they did violated the law, because they still think they\u2019re right.\u201d  Defense attorneys for some of the fake electors told CNN they think Nessel crossed a line, and outside legal experts said her comments might make it harder for her to win convictions. Shan Wu, a former federal prosecutor who supports charging the fake electors, said it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for Nessel to be \u201cinsulting defendants\u201d that her office is prosecuting.  \u201cIt undermines the validity of her prosecution theory,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIf you think these people are brainwashed, then they didn\u2019t have the right state of mind and couldn\u2019t form the criminal intent to break the law, because they were being brainwashed by others.\u201d  A spokesperson for Nessel did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Nessel\u2019s comments at the progressive event were first reported by The Detroit News.  The event featuring Nessel was hosted by a progressive podcaster and promoted by Protectors of Equality in Government, a left-leaning advocacy group based in Michigan.   The 16 fake electors charged in Michigan have pleaded not guilty. They include current and former state GOP officials, a mayor, a school board member, and several elderly local party activists. Some of the fake electors continue to peddle false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The group met on December 14, 2020, and signed certificates falsely proclaiming that Trump won the state and they were the \u201cduly elected and qualified electors.\u201d The Trump campaign hoped these slates of phony electors would supplant candidate Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate Democratic electors when Congress certified the results on January 6, 2021.   Each fake elector is charged with eight felonies.  Separately, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith has accused Trump of directing the scheme, which his campaign orchestrated in seven battleground states. The Michigan fake electors were not charged in that proceeding.  Touting the jury pool  The video obtained by CNN shows that Nessel decried the recent acquittals of three men who were charged in connection with the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. Nessel contrasted that case, which was tried in a rural conservative county, to the fake electors case, which is in the state capital of Lansing, where she filed the charges.    \u201cIngham County, where Lansing was located, is a very, very Democratic-leaning county,\u201d Nessel said. \u201cBut I worry that there will be people who just won\u2019t care that they clearly violated the law because they believe that the ends justify the means. And that, you know, it\u2019s okay to do as long as the end game is getting this autocrat into office.\u201d  Kevin Kijewski, an attorney for fake elector Clifford Frost, 75, said Nessel\u2019s remarks were \u201cdisturbing\u201d and that some of her comments could help him fight the charges.  \u201cThis seems to be more of a political calculation by the attorney general, as opposed to trying to seek out the truth and adjudicate this case on the merits,\u201d Kijewski said, adding that he thinks Nessel\u2019s \u201cbrainwashed\u201d comment is \u201cnot only defamatory but also damaging to the trust that people have in our judicial system, and to the rule of law.\u201d  Kijewski said Frost recognizes that Biden \u201cis the legitimate president.\u201d However, Frost posted an article Tuesday on Facebook with the title, \u201cTrump won Michigan in 2020.\u201d (The post was removed after CNN asked Kijewski about it.)  A hearing is scheduled for early October for Frost\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges, where his attorney is arguing that Nessel is trying to criminalize a \u201cfutile political protest,\u201d referring to the fake Electoral College certificates. Additional hearings are set for later in October and November, as the 16 cases move toward potential trials.  \u201cThis shows they have no case, and she just admitted it,\u201d said Nick Somberg, a lawyer for Meshawn Maddock, a charged fake elector and former Michigan GOP co-chair.

In his letter to staffers announcing his exit Thursday, Murdoch attempted to portray himself as a gladiator who fought \u201cthe battle for the freedom of speech and, ultimately, the freedom of thought.\u201d Sounding like one of the Fox News pundits on his payroll, Murdoch bashed the \u201celites\u201d who he portrayed as having \u201copen contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class.\u201d \u201cMost of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth,\u201d Murdoch wrote, without any sense of irony. Murdoch, himself a billionaire many times over who has spent his life rubbing shoulders with society\u2019s most elite members, must have known that deep down in his bones he was offering up a fitting description of himself \u2014 a man whose companies printed money through the peddling of outrageous narratives aimed at satisfying the thirst of his tragically duped audience. Murdoch, who personally took great precaution during the pandemic and was later one of the world\u2019s first recipients of the Covid-19 vaccine, stood by silently as he handsomely paid his roster of right-wing commentators who promoted lies about the virus and sewed conspiracy theories about the life-saving jabs. The cost of those lies, which was paid in the form of actual human lives who turned to the outlet they entrusted with their own health decisions, might never be fully known, but it was unquestionably too high. The cost, however, of the election lies that Murdoch\u2019s Fox News spread to protect Donald Trump is more easily measurable, courtesy of the mammoth defamation lawsuits brought by voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Murdoch, who behind the scenes rejected the unhinged rhetoric that was broadcast on his air, paid Dominion a historic $787.5 million to settle and avert a jury trial earlier this year. Fox News still faces a $2.7 billion lawsuit from Smartmatic. The question coursing through media circles in the wake of Murdoch\u2019s stunning announcement is: Why now? Why did he decide that Thursday, September 21, 2023, would be the day to announce he would be stepping down and vacating the throne? Murdoch is a strategic thinker and ruthless businessman, who would have given the timing of his exit immense thought.  Is the announcement an indication that Murdoch is attempting to further cement his son, Lachlan, as his successor? Does he believe that naming Lachlan as chairman of both of his companies before his death, whenever that might be, will make it more difficult for his other children to overthrow him upon his passing? Perhaps Murdoch believes that if he seats Lachlan on the throne and places the crown atop his head, it will eliminate \u2014 or at least shrink \u2014 the power vacuum that his death is surely to spawn.  Or perhaps there is something else at play. Murdoch said in his note that he is in \u201crobust health.\u201d But he is 92, after all, and has slowed down in recent years. The other question is: How will this transition impact the organization of Murdoch\u2019s companies? Murdoch stressed that Lachlan shares his ideological worldview. But the executive ranks of Fox and News Corporations are comprised of Murdoch\u2019s own lifelong, loyal lieutenants. Will Lachlan make some changes? Will he empower a new generation?  And the biggest question of all: Does Murdoch have some additional surprises left up his sleeve? Are there more shoes to drop? We will see.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T10:46:25Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921092047-01-east-coast-storm-friday-weekend-climate-satellite.jpg?c=original", "title": "Tropical storm warning issued for parts of East Coast ahead of weekend rain, wind risk", "content": "A tropical storm warning has been posted for parts of the North Carolina and mid-Atlantic coasts for a developing storm that will bring gusty winds, heavy rain, dangerous rip currents and coastal flooding to areas from Florida to New England as it tracks north near the coast into this weekend.  The area of low pressure, dubbed Potential Tropical Cyclone 16 by the National Hurricane Center, currently has 35 mph winds off the east coast of Florida. It\u2019s expected to strengthen into a tropical storm by Friday as it approaches the North Carolina coast, the National Hurricane Center said. Depending on when it is named, it could be called Ophelia or Philippe.  The tropical storm warning was issued from just south of Wilmington, North Carolina, to the Maryland-Delaware state line. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive in North Carolina as soon as Friday, before pushing into the mid-Atlantic on Saturday. A storm surge watch was also issued for parts of the same stretch of coastline, with up to 4 feet of surge possible from Surf City, North Carolina, to the Virginia Tidewater.  The storm was slowly coming together on Thursday and causing rain and storms to bubble to life over parts of Florida\u2019s northeast coast and far southeastern Georgia. Breezy conditions also ramped up and caused worsening seas, but the storm\u2019s worst will come this weekend. Miserable weekend weather coming from East Coast storm Widespread rain As the coastal storm becomes more organized on Friday, rainfall will shift into parts of the Carolinas and Virginia. Rain will stretch hundreds of miles from its center as it treks north through the weekend and drench portions of the mid-Atlantic during the day Saturday and even parts of New England by Saturday night.  The heaviest rainfall will remain largely confined to areas close to the coast, but inland areas will still have to deal with stormy weather, which could disrupt outdoor plans. The greatest risk for heavy rain and flooding is expected in far eastern North Carolina, with totals of 4 to 6 inches likely.  Two to 4 inches of rain on Saturday through Sunday could impact a much larger swath of the eastern US from central North Carolina to New Jersey and New York. Even southern New England and inland areas, like Pennsylvania, could see 1 to 2 inches of rain this weekend. Strong winds Wind speeds will also increase on Friday for coastal areas, gusting 30 to 40 mph, with higher gusts possible closer to the center of the storm. The strongest winds are expected to arrive Friday for portions of the Carolinas and spread northward through the rest of the mid-Atlantic later Friday into Saturday.  These wind gusts, coupled with soaked ground, may bring down trees, which could cause property damage and power outages. Coastal threats As the storm treks north, the risk for dangerous rip currents will be elevated along much of the East Coast as it churns up hazardous seas. The weather service warned of a high risk for rip currents headed into the weekend for sections of the coastline from Florida to New Jersey. Coastal flooding is also possible for portions of North Carolina northward into New Jersey as the storm moves up the coast this weekend. Major-to-moderate flooding is forecast for several spots in the Virginia Tidewater and along Delaware Bay on Saturday as the storm\u2019s strong winds push water into rivers at the coast.  In spots where major flooding occurs, numerous roads and homes and businesses could be inundated, according to NOAA.

About 6 in 10 New Hampshire residents, 62%, say they would be dissatisfied or worse if Trump retook the presidency \u2013 with most, 56%, expressing outright anger at the prospect. A 56% majority say they\u2019d be dissatisfied or worse if Biden won reelection, but fewer, 38%, say they\u2019d be angry. About one-fifth say they\u2019d be less than satisfied with either scenario. But in a head-to-head matchup between Biden and Trump, a narrow majority, 52%, of potential 2024 voters in the state say they\u2019d back Biden, with 40% favoring Trump and 8% unsure or saying they would back someone else. That\u2019s a wider edge for Biden than in most recent national polling on the matchup, which has largely found a margin-of-error contest between the two most recent occupants of the White House. There\u2019s also little consensus that any of those challenging Biden or Trump for their party\u2019s nominations would be a good choice. Nearly half, 48%, say they\u2019d be dissatisfied or angry if South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott were to win the presidency next year, with the numbers going up from there. Majorities say they\u2019d be unhappy with a win by former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (57%), tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy (62%), Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (63%), former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (72%) or former Vice President Mike Pence (76%). On the Democratic side, most also say they\u2019d be unhappy with a win by author Marianne Williamson (56%) or environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (59%). Biden\u2019s edge in a New Hampshire rematch of 2020 rests partly on stronger support among his own partisans: 94% of Democrats currently say they\u2019d back him against Trump, while 79% of Republicans in the state now say they\u2019d support Trump. Yet Democrats are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a Biden presidency than Republicans are about a Trump one. Few Democrats in the state are outright discontented with the thought of a second Biden term \u2013 about 8 in 10 say they\u2019d be satisfied to see him reelected. But just 31% report that they\u2019re enthusiastic about the prospect, with that number falling to 19% among Democrats younger than age 50. Among Republicans, by contrast, 53% say they would be enthusiastic about a Trump win.  Despite the lack of enthusiasm, Biden remains the unquestioned leader in the campaign for the state\u2019s primary: He holds a commanding 78% support among likely Democratic primary voters, with Kennedy and Williamson both in the single digits (at 9% and 6%, respectively). And a majority of Democratic primary voters, including three-quarters of Biden\u2019s supporters, say their minds are definitely made up. The New Hampshire primary is traditionally the first in the nation. Its date for 2024 has not yet been scheduled, though it is widely expected to be set for January. A January primary in New Hampshire, however, would violate the Democratic National Committee\u2019s rules. If that happened, Biden likely wouldn\u2019t put his name on the ballot. But even in that case, 69% of Biden supporters say they would write him in anyway. Likely Democratic primary voters in the state see few plausible alternatives to a Biden-led ticket. While 81% would be enthusiastic or satisfied if Biden won reelection, fewer than 1 in 5 Democratic primary voters feel the same way about either Kennedy (17%) or Williamson (12%). Just 9% hold a favorable view of Williamson, with 47% viewing her unfavorably and the rest neutral or unsure; Kennedy gets an identical 9% favorability rating, but with a 73% majority rating him unfavorably. Just 37% say there\u2019s someone else besides the current candidates they\u2019d like to see run in the Democratic primary, but there\u2019s little agreement as to whom: 7% of all likely Democratic primary voters name Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with smaller numbers suggesting Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg (5%), California Gov. Gavin Newsom (4%) or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (3%). Considering Vice President Kamala Harris, 63% of Democratic primary voters say they\u2019re at least satisfied with her as Biden\u2019s running mate, though just 21% describe themselves as enthusiastic about her. Another 26% are dissatisfied or angry, with the remainder unsure. More broadly, Harris prompts largely negative views among New Hampshirites overall, with 54% saying they have a negative view of her and 23% a positive one. Even among Democrats, just 46% say they have a favorable view of Harris and 14% a negative one, well below Biden\u2019s 70% favorability rating among Democrats in the state.  An 86% majority of likely Democratic primary voters approve of Biden\u2019s current job performance overall, although only about half say their approval is strongly held. When asked to name their top concern about Biden as a candidate, 57% of likely Democratic primary voters cite his age, with 4% mentioning his health. Relatively few concerns focused on his character (6%), his policies (4%) or attacks he might face from opponents or the media (4%). And few see a major disconnect between their own political views and Biden\u2019s. A 43% plurality say Biden\u2019s ideology is similar to their own views, with 39% saying Biden\u2019s views are further right than their own (32% slightly, just 7% by far), and 16% that his views are further left than theirs (9% slightly, 7% far). Among New Hampshire residents as a whole, Biden\u2019s job approval ratings remain underwater \u2013 46% approve, while 54% disapprove \u2013 although that\u2019s slightly stronger than his average approval rating nationally, which stands at 40% in the latest CNN Poll of Polls. Four in 10 say he\u2019s had the right priorities during his administration, with 57% saying he hasn\u2019t paid enough attention to the country\u2019s most important problems.  Many express concerns about Biden\u2019s physical and mental health in the poll. Just shy of half (46%) say that Biden is currently definitely or probably mentally and physically capable of fulfilling his duties as president, with 52% saying they don\u2019t believe he is. Looking ahead, confidence in Biden\u2019s abilities declines as just 35% think Biden would definitely or probably be capable of fulfilling his duties for another full term. Yet Biden still holds the advantage in hypothetical general matchups against top Republicans, and his chief rival, Trump, is even more unpopular than Biden in the state. Among New Hampshire\u2019s potential 2024 general electorate \u2013 those who say they intend to vote in November 2024 \u2013 Biden\u2019s unfavorability rating stands at 52%, while Trump\u2019s tops that at 63%. The hypothetical matchup between the two somewhat mirrors the results of the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election, which Biden won 53% to 45%. Trump came significantly closer to carrying the state in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton bested him by less than 3,000 votes. Biden also holds double-digit leads in hypothetical New Hampshire tests against DeSantis, Ramaswamy, Pence, Scott, Haley and Christie, but substantial numbers of potential voters in each these matchups \u2013 between 9% and 16% \u2013 volunteer that they\u2019d instead choose to vote for Trump. That comes almost entirely among Republicans, 18% of whom say they would vote for Trump in a Biden vs. Ramaswamy matchup, rising all the way up to 35% saying they would vote Trump in a Biden vs. Christie matchup. Voters\u2019 desire for an additional option doesn\u2019t always translate from polls to the ballot box \u2013 in 2020, fewer than 2% of New Hampshire voters picked a candidate other than Biden or Trump. And should someone other than Trump become the GOP nominee, it is likely that these Republicans would ultimately vote for that candidate. But the current numbers reflect the depth of some Republican voters\u2019 ties to Trump. The eventual nominees are likely to face off in a pessimistic political environment that sees Granite State residents expressing discontent about both pocketbook issues and issues like abortion. Just 1 in 4 New Hampshire residents see the country as headed in the right direction. About half, 51%, say their family\u2019s finances are worse off than they were at the beginning of the Biden administration, with 32% saying they\u2019re doing about the same and just 16% that they\u2019re now better off. Most Republicans (84%) say they\u2019re worse off, as do 58% of those without a college degree. By 59% to 37%, New Hampshire residents oppose last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. A 54% majority describe themselves as \u201cstrongly\u201d opposed, with such strong opposition especially high among Democrats (90%), women (63%) and adults younger than 35 (59%). Views are more closely split on New Hampshire\u2019s law banning abortion after 24 weeks, except in cases of medical emergency, with 45% of state residents in support and 47% opposed. The CNN New Hampshire poll was conducted online September 14-18 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Results among the full sample of 2,107 New Hampshire adults drawn from a probability-based panel have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.1 percentage points. Likely Democratic primary voters and potential 2024 general election voters were identified through survey questions about their intention to vote. Results among 953 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is 2.2 points for results among the 2,060 people in the potential 2024 electorate.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T09:00:07Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230915133658-mime-palestinians-west-bank-israel-overhaul.jpg?c=original", "title": "Netanyahu\u2019s judicial overhaul sparks Palestinian fears of \u2018speedy\u2019 West Bank annexation", "content": "For nearly nine months, tens of thousands of Israelis have protested every week against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan to overhaul the judiciary, concerned that it risks severely curtailing the powers of the Supreme Court, the only body that provides a check on the executive and legislative branches of government.     Meanwhile, watching and worrying from the sidelines, many Palestinians fear a weakened Supreme Court could lead to the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and the eventual annexation of the territory they want for a future state.     Most Israelis have cited the erosion of democracy and human rights in protesting the overhaul, but its potential implications on more than three million Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank haven\u2019t played a significant part in the public discourse.     Sawsan Zaher, a Palestinian citizen of Israel and human rights lawyer working with the Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights in Israel, argues the implications could be enormous. She refers to the overhaul as a \u201cjudicial coup,\u201d saying it risks facilitating the \u201cde facto annexation of the West Bank without any critique or any review\u201d from the Supreme Court.       Zaher\u2019s concern is rooted in words and actions that Netanyahu government has taken since coming into power at the end of last year. The cabinet includes a number of West Bank settlers in powerful positions, and the agreement that brought together the government calls for extending Israel\u2019s sovereignty in the West Bank, effectively a call for annexation.    Under Netanyahu\u2019s far-right government, Israel has approved a record number of housing units in West Bank settlements, Peace Now said in a July report.     Most countries and the United Nations consider the West Bank and East Jerusalem as occupied and therefore view Israeli settlements there as illegal under international law. Israel says the territory is disputed and denies its settlements there are illegal.  Many Israelis support their government\u2019s expansion into the occupied territories. A 2020 survey by the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute found that more than half of Jewish Israelis supported extending Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank, an ambition that Netanyahu has voiced.    The overhaul includes a number of bills, the first of which passed in July by a 64-0 vote, thanks to the entire opposition walking out in protest before the vote. That law strips the Supreme Court of the power to declare government decisions unreasonable.    Supporters of the overhaul say that the judicial system in Israel is flawed, and gives too much power to the court. Some have been calling for judicial reform for years, saying it would balance all three branches of government.    Last week, the Supreme Court heard challenges to the reasonableness law, with the entire panel of 15 judges convening for the first time ever to hear a case.    Justices grilled lawyers from both sides rigorously, giving little indication which way they would rule. It is unclear when the court will announce its decision on the reasonableness law.     The ruling could be historic, since the reasonableness law is an amendment to one of Israel\u2019s 13 Basic Laws. Unlike many democracies, Israel doesn\u2019t have a written constitution. Instead, it relies on Basic Laws, as well as court ruling precedents that could one day become a constitution.  The court has never struck down a Basic Law or an amendment to one.     \u201cIf you look at the core essence and intentions of the judicial coup, it is basically to stop the Supreme Court from having any kind of judicial review on Basic Laws or government decisions,\u201d Zaher told CNN.    A narrow avenue for legal recourse     Experts say that while the Supreme Court has generally supported Israel\u2019s settlement expansion, it has sometimes provided a narrow avenue for legal recourse by Palestinians.     Eliav Lieblich, a law professor at Tel Aviv University said the court has never hindered the settlement movement. \u201cIt never ruled on the overall legality of the settlement projects.\u201d    What it did do, he said, is \u201cprovide specific protections for situations in which private property of Palestinians has been infringed, or otherwise used for settlements,\u201d Lieblich told CNN.     But Zaher said that Palestinians have never considered the Supreme Court as sympathetic to their cause, and that Netanyahu\u2019s overhaul risks scrapping any remaining mechanisms, no matter how small, that can override policies viewed by Palestinians as violations of their rights.      \u201cDid the Supreme Court protect Palestinian rights in the West Bank? The answer clearly is that in 95% of cases, no,\u201d Zaher estimated.    Palestinians in the West Bank fall under a different set of laws than Israelis. They are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple, separate authorities, including the Palestinian Authority and Israeli military laws. West Bank Palestinians have the option of petitioning Israeli courts to rule against evictions, demolitions or land seizures, even if there\u2019s a slim chance of success.     According to human rights organizations, the Supreme Court approves the majority of the orders for demolition of the family homes of Palestinians engaged in attacks against Israelis, and rarely grants petitions filed by Palestinians against those measures. The practice has been criticized by rights groups as collective punishment. Israel argues that it deters future attacks.    Palestinians have however had some rare victories. In 2005, the Supreme Court ordered the government to come up with a new route for part of its security barrier in the northern West Bank to minimize hardship for Palestinians. The International Court of Justice in The Hague had said a year earlier that the entire barrier is illegal.    And in 2012, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group of Palestinian landowners, ordering the removal of five settler buildings in the West Bank above the Palestinian village of Dura al-Qara.   More recently in 2017, Israeli security forces bulldozed nine homes built on private Palestinian land in the West Bank settlement of Ofra. The decision to destroy the homes came after the High Court of Justice struck down an appeal by the settler residents of Ofra to evacuate the homes but not destroy them. The court had issued the demolition ruling in 2015, seven years after the legal aid group representing the Palestinian landowner filed the case in 2008.    In other cases, however, rulings in favor of Palestinians have been reversed. Last year, in an unprecedented move, the high court ruled that a settlement outpost \u2013 Israeli housing in the West Bank built without government authorization \u2013 on private Palestinian land can remain place, almost two years after ordering its removal.      Fears of \u2018speedy\u2019 annexation     Palestinians say that settlement expansion under the Netanyahu government suggests there will be even less restraint on expansion when the Supreme Court is no longer a bureaucratic hurdle for the government.   There may be \u201can acceleration of the annexation in a speedy way that we did not see before,\u201d Zaher said.     Ahmed Tibi, a Palestinian-Israeli member of Israel\u2019s parliament and head of the Ta\u2019al party, said that supporters of the reasonableness law include far-right ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, both of whom are settlers. These supporters, Tibi said, \u201caim to control the judicial system to facilitate the annexation of occupied territories.\u201d    \u201cMany suggestions (in the judicial overhaul) would benefit the settlers,\u201d Tibi told CNN. \u201cAnything that strengthens the settlers tends to weaken the Palestinians.\u201d     Gershon Baskin, director of the Holy Land Bond, a new investment fund aimed at investing in housing projects for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, sees settlement expansions as being at the heart of Netanyahu\u2019s judicial plan.     \u201cThe small avenues that Palestinians have found within the Israeli High Court are going to be closed doors in the not-too-distant future if Netanyahu is successful in pushing through the reform,\u201d Baskin said.     While the formal annexation of the West Bank is \u201can extreme scenario,\u201d Lieblich said, it would be easier to do if the Supreme Court is severely weakened, with no authority to review government decisions. Weakening judicial review would also make it easier to take incremental steps that could amount to annexation for all practical purposes, he said.   \u201cOnce you diminish judicial review, you empower the executive, in what is already a zero-sum game (between Israel and the Palestinians),\u201d he added.

Decades later, the desecrated stone slabs began to emerge during renovation works. Now, thanks to the hard work of a charity based in Belarus and the United Kingdom, the headstones will be given the respect they deserve as part of a new memorial on the site.  The haunting structure will be erected at the site of the former cemetery in Brest, crafted from broken bits of headstones that have resurfaced over the past two decades in the city and the surrounding area.  Brest, also known as Brest-Litovsk, had been a hub of Jewish life before World War II, with Jewish residents first recorded there in the 14th century. It was home to more than 20,000 Jews before the war. After the Holocaust, only about 10 remained, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s national Holocaust memorial center. Tens of thousands of people are believed to have been buried in the cemetery, among them famous rabbis and talmudic sages, but today there is little evidence their graves ever existed.   The first stage of the desecration began during the war, when the Nazis tried to destroy the cemetery by selling off the headstones. That destruction continued under the Soviets in the post-war era, when they proceeded to use the religious markers for paving slabs and building works \u2013 before later covering the whole site in asphalt to create a running track and football stadium, according to representatives of the Jewish community in Belarus today. The sports facilities, although run down, still exist on the site and are open to the public. All traces of the once-sprawling cemetery had been lost until the late 1990s, when parts of the broken stones began to resurface during construction work in and around the city.  \u201cCurrently there\u2019s nothing there to say it\u2019s a cemetery,\u201d said Debra Brunner, chief executive and co-founder of The Together Plan, a charity spearheading the memorial project. Over the past few years, hundreds of remnants of matzevot \u2013 the Hebrew word for headstones \u2013 have been collected and stored in a warehouse, where they have been photographed, cataloged and added to a detailed and searchable database. They will now form part of a large memorial at the site.  \u201cThere are 1,287 pieces with any sign of writing and probably between 2,000 and 2,500 more pieces but with no signs of writing,\u201d said Artur Livshyts, co-director of The Together Plan, whose US partner organization is called The Jewish Tapestry Project.  Earlier this year, Livshyts, one of around 20,000 Jewish people living in the Belarusian capital, Minsk, was contacted by a young couple who had just bought a dilapidated house in Brest which had stood empty for more than 20 years. Brunner said: \u201cIt was in very bad condition but they bought it to renovate it. During their building works they discovered that the basement was constructed out of matzevot. It turns out that after the war the family who lived in this house had used the matzevot as building materials.\u201d After that family suffered a series of misfortunes, people said this was \u201ca curse from the headstones,\u201d Brunner said. \u201cWhen this new couple discovered the headstones they felt compelled to do the right thing and so they reached out to the Jewish community in Brest to ask what to do.\u201d The memorial, which Brunner and Livshyts hope will be in situ by the end of 2024, aims to \u201cacknowledge and honor the community that was so brutally extinguished, and educate visitors about Brest\u2019s vibrant Jewish community of today,\u201d according to the charity. The memorial will be located on a corner of the site, away from the sports facilities. It will feature a black granite plaque with writing in English, Russian and Hebrew, while the surrounding area will be landscaped with trees, grass and wild flowers. The Brest municipality is supportive of the concept and has pledged to maintain its upkeep once it opens, according to The Together Plan. The office of the mayor of Brest has not yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the project. Belarus, under President Alexander Lukashenko, has come under international pressure over its role in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and repression of civil society. The charity estimates that it must raise around $325,000 for the memorial \u2013 a third of which has been pledged by a donor, Stephen Grynberg, with a close connection to Brest\u2019s Jewish past. Grynberg\u2019s late father, Jack, was one of the handful of Brest\u2019s Jewish residents to survive the Holocaust. The Los Angeles-based film maker told CNN that dozens of his relatives were killed by the Nazis.  In the 1990s, Grynberg worked as an interviewer for the Shoah Foundation, an initiative set up by Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg to record the testimonies of Holocaust survivors. Inspired by its work, he persuaded his father to try to open up about his wartime experiences and together they traveled back to Brest.  \u201cThat trip was really profound for me,\u201d Grynberg, 60, told CNN. \u201cWhat I came to learn was that there were 70 to 100 family members in this town and they all perished. Dad\u2019s grandparents on both sides, uncles, aunts, cousins. His whole family other than his nuclear family was murdered.\u201d He added: \u201cIn 1997 there were no signs of the cemetery. We were taken there and our guide said \u2018this is where the cemetery was.\u2019 Like so many things with the Holocaust, you can\u2019t really understand them, you just have these complicated visceral feelings. I was just trying to compute the idea of them bulldozing a cemetery and building on it. That was the empty feeling I had.\u201d In 2015, Grynberg returned to Brest, where he heard about the instances of headstones resurfacing during construction work, and met with Brunner and Livshyts. Embracing their vision for a memorial at the former cemetery site, Grynberg commissioned Texas-based designer Brad Goldberg \u2013 whose family had taken in Grynberg\u2019s father when he first arrived in the United States and knew him well \u2013 to come up with a plan for it.  \u201cI\u2019m not sure but I don\u2019t think I had any relatives in this cemetery because my family came to Brest,\u201d said Grynberg, who explained that his grandparents had moved to Brest, so his ancestors are likely to have been buried elsewhere in Belarus. \u201cThese are all people buried there before the war. It really feels more about my connection to what this town is.\u201d The intention, he said, is not to replicate a cemetery, but to bring \u201cdignity back to the people who are buried in this place.\u201d In a telephone interview with CNN, Goldberg said his design comprises two large arcs enclosing a large space on the site, which will feature some of the broken stones.  \u201cI call it an embrace,\u201d he said. \u201cThis embrace is meant to house those headstones that are still intact. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a cemetery,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are all facing in different directions as if they are having a conversation with each other.  \u201cOne rabbi that we have consulted has described it as being about life rather than about death.\u201d Livshyts told CNN: \u201cThis will lay the stones to rest, back where they belong. I call it historical justice.\u201d  He added: \u201cOf course we can\u2019t locate the actual bodies to the stones that are there but at least we can bring back the stones and have them standing where the cemetery used to be.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T04:40:40Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922011918-01-ggv-capital-jenny-lee-091523-restricted.jpg?c=original", "title": "Another top Silicon Valley investor is splitting off its China business as pressure mounts", "content": "GGV Capital, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm, has become the latest big investor to break up its US and China operations into separate companies as tensions between the two countries over tech and geopolitics continue to rise. The firm announced Thursday that it would divide its business into two \u201ccompletely independent\u201d firms with separate new brands, which have not been revealed. According to the company, one side will concentrate on North America, Latin America, Europe, Israel and cross-border US-India deals, led by teams in California and New York by managing partners Glenn Solomon, Hans Tung, Jeff Richards and Oren Yunger.  The other side will focus on China, Southeast Asia and South Asia, run from its headquarters in Singapore, by managing partners Jenny Lee and Jixun Foo. GGV\u2019s existing Chinese yuan-denominated funds \u201cwill continue to be managed independently\u201d under its Chinese brand, Jiyuan Capital, it said.  In a statement, the firm attributed the decision to the fact that \u201cover the last decade, the investment landscape has shifted significantly, and the operating environment has become highly complex.\u201d \u201cAgainst these new realities, GGV is also evolving,\u201d it added, without elaborating further. The transition is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of next year. GGV Capital has approximately $9.2 billion in assets under management. The firm is known for backing tech companies around the world, such as Alibaba (BABA), Airbnb (ABNB), Slack, TikTok owner ByteDance and Chinese ride-hailing provider Didi. The move comes as US-China tensions continue to affect how businesses operate across the world\u2019s top two economies. Last month, the Biden administration announced it would restrict investments by US venture capital and private equity firms, as well as joint ventures, in Chinese artificial intelligence, quantum computing and semiconductors.  The executive order will exacerbate a slump in deals between the United States and China, and deliver a \u201cmajor blow\u201d to Chinese startups, analysts and investors previously told CNN. Asked whether the US order or wider geopolitical tensions had factored into its decision, GGV Capital declined to comment. The firm has recently come under greater scrutiny from US lawmakers.  In July, a US House committee said it had sent letters to four investment firms, including GGV, \u201cexpressing serious concern and demanding information about the firms\u2019 investments\u201d in artificial intelligence, chips and quantum computing companies in China. One investment named was a GGV deal with Megvii, an AI developer. The company is best known for its facial recognition software, and has long been accused of human rights violations against Uyghurs and other members of Muslim minority groups in China\u2019s Xinjiang region. Megvii was added to a US trade blacklist in 2019 over the issue and previously told CNN that there were \u201cno grounds\u201d for that decision. The ongoing pressure has already led other firms to separate their US and Chinese businesses this year. In June, top global venture capital firm Sequoia announced a similar decision to cordon off its operations into three entities that cover Europe and the United States; China; and India and Southeast Asia. Its China business will be run independently under its Chinese name, Hongshan. Leaders of the Silicon Valley firm said at the time that it had \u201cbecome increasingly complex to run a decentralized global investment business.\u201d In August, Dentons, a leading law firm, also said its China unit would become a standalone legal entity, in response to new Chinese regulations related to data privacy, cybersecurity and capital control.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T08:49:12Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230908104024-chevron-strike-australia.jpg?c=original", "title": "Unions in Australia call off strikes at Chevron\u2019s LNG plants", "content": "Union workers have called off strikes at liquefied natural gas facilities belonging to Chevron in Australia, ending a standoff that could have affected about 7% of global LNG supply. Both Chevron (CVX) and Offshore Alliance, which represents the Australian Workers\u2019 Union and the Maritime Union of Australia, said Friday they had accepted new employment agreements proposed by Australia\u2019s Fair Work Commission, the workplace relations tribunal.  The proposed deals now \u201ccontain substantial improvements in terms and conditions of employment, including increased remuneration, job security, locked-in rosters [and] career progression,\u201d the alliance said in a statement. \u201cThe Offshore Alliance will now work with Chevron to finalize the drafting of the three agreements,\u201d it added. Chevron said in a statement that it had \u201caccepted the recommendation to resolve all outstanding issues.\u201d \u201cThe unions have advised Chevron Australia and the Fair Work Commission that industrial action has been suspended,\u201d it added. Workers at Chevron\u2019s Gorgon and Wheatstone facilities began walking off the job two weeks ago over pay and other conditions. The sites, located by the coast of Western Australia, are hugely significant. If strikes had stopped production at the facilities for a month, about 7% of global supply would have been lost, according to Daniel Toleman, a principal research analyst of global LNG at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. \u201cThere has not been a material impact on global LNG supply. Prices are likely to soften, and volatility will be removed from the market,\u201d Toleman told CNN on Friday. In Europe, the threat of strikes had sent natural gas prices higher several times over the past month. The region has become more dependent on global LNG supplies since deliveries of pipeline gas from Russia slumped following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  Europe has been stockpiling ahead of the winter heating season, managing to hit a storage target last month ahead of schedule. But despite the nearly full tanks, investors had been unnerved as talks in Australia appeared to break down in recent weeks. Workers notified Chevron of their plans to strike in late August, about a week after the energy giant presented an offer that failed to impress union members. In a statement at the time, the Offshore Alliance said the proposed compensation was \u201clower than some Tier 2 oil and gas operators in Australian waters.\u201d A market leader like Chevron should align its pay rates with industry peers, such as Shell (SHEL), it had argued.  The tensions led to weeks of acrimonious debate, prompting Australia\u2019s arbitrator to step in this week at the request of Chevron.

The news was announced just weeks after official data showed foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country had hit a record quarterly low amid a slump in business confidence. Foreign investors \u2014 either individuals or companies \u2014 at the Shanghai pilot free trade zone, where tens of thousands of firms are located, can remit their funds without any restriction or delay, according to a statement from the city government posted Thursday.  The funds need be \u201creal and [legally] compliant\u201d and related to their investments in China, it said. The rules, which do not apply to mainland Chinese nationals, took effect on September 1. Shanghai\u2019s free trade zone is one of China\u2019s largest and is slightly bigger than the city of Seattle. It\u2019s home to Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory as well as the country headquarters of hundreds of multinationals, including HP, AstraZeneca and BlackRock. On the same day, the Beijing city government proposed similar regulations, pledging to facilitate cross-border fund flows for foreign businesses. It\u2019s seeking public feedback on the proposal. The policies are aimed at attracting foreign investment to build an open economy, the government said. China maintains a \u201cclosed\u201d capital account, which means companies and individuals can\u2019t move money in or out of the country except in accordance with strict rules.  The Chinese currency has weakened more than 6% against the US dollar since the start of April, as economic growth lost momentum and its central bank eased monetary policy more aggressively than its Western peers. A weak currency could further reduce a country\u2019s investment appeal and accelerate the outflow of capital. Thursday\u2019s measures are the latest effort by Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s government to woo foreign capital and stabilize ties with the West. A gauge of FDI in China plunged in the second quarter, hitting its lowest level since 1998, when records began, according to data published by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange last month. Separate statistics published by the commerce ministry Sunday showed that its measure of FDI dropped more than 5% during the first eight months of 2023, compared with a year earlier.  Low confidence Business confidence among American firms in China appears to have plummeted.  On Tuesday, a survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai showed that only 52% of respondents were optimistic about their five-year business outlook, the lowest level since the survey began in 1999. That compares with 55% in 2022 and 78% in 2021. Foreign companies and investors have grown wary of rising risks in the world\u2019s second largest economy, including a slowdown marked by weak domestic demand and a housing crisis, Beijing\u2019s desire to prioritize national security over economic growth and deteriorating relations between China and many Western countries. China has made a series of moves recently to stabilize foreign trade and investment, including cutting a tax on stock trading for the first time since 2008. On Monday, the People\u2019s Bank of China met with a number of top Western companies, including JP Morgan, Tesla and HSBC, pledging to further open up the financial industry and \u201coptimize\u201d the operating environment for overseas companies. The latest relaxation in capital controls is part of a policy package announced by Beijing and Shanghai, the country\u2019s two biggest cities, to facilitate foreign trade and investment. Expatriates working at foreign enterprises in the Shanghai free trade zone \u2014 including employees from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan \u2014 can transfer their income abroad without restriction, according to the rules. Beijing\u2019s policy contains similar measures.

In a strongly worded statement to reporters Thursday, India\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said Canada needed to \u201cworry about its international reputation\u201d in the wake of its explosive allegations.   He added: \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about reputational issues and reputational damage, if there\u2019s any country that needs to look at this, I think it\u2019s Canada and its growing reputation as a place, as a safe haven for terrorists, for extremists, and for organized crime.\u201d  His comments followed India\u2019s move to suspend visa applications for Canadian citizens over what it says are \u201csecurity threats\u201d against diplomats in the country.  \u201cThe issue is of incitement of violence, the inaction by the Canadian authorities, the creation of an environment that disrupts the functioning of our high commission and consulates, that\u2019s what\u2019s making us stop temporarily the issuance of visas or providing visa services,\u201d Bagchi added.  Relations between the two countries plummeted this week after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said India was potentially behind the June killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist activist, who was gunned down by two masked men in Surrey, British Columbia.  India has vehemently denied the claims, calling them \u201cabsurd and motivated.\u201d Bagchi said Canada has provided \u201cno specific information\u201d to support the allegations.  India\u2019s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Thursday issued an advisory to television channels, asking them to refrain from \u201cgiving any platform to persons who are facing serious charges, such as terrorism or belonging to organizations proscribed by law.\u201d The Indian government has long accused Canada of inaction in dealing with what it says is Sikh separatist extremism aimed at creating a separate Sikh homeland that would be known as Khalistan and include parts of India\u2019s Punjab state.  Nijjar was an outspoken supporter of the creation of Khalistan. India considers calls for Khalistan a grave national security threat.  A number of groups associated with the idea of Khalistan are listed as \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d under India\u2019s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Nijjar\u2019s name appears on the list of UAPA terrorists and in 2020, the Indian National Investigation Agency accused him of \u201ctrying to radicalize the Sikh community across the world in favor of the creation of \u2018Khalistan.\u2019\u201d Several Sikh organizations overseas say the movement is being falsely equated with terrorism by the Indian government, and say they will continue to peacefully advocate for the creation of Khalistan, while bringing to light what they say is years of human rights abuses faced by the community in India.  The history of Khalistan Sikhs once had their own kingdom in the Punjab and the push for the creation of Khalistan dates back decades, to around the time India gained independence from its British colonial rulers in 1947.  When Partition hastily divided the former colony along religious lines \u2013 sending Muslims to the newly formed nation of Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs to newly independent India \u2013 Punjab, which was sliced in half, saw some of the worst violence. Sikhs suffered heavily in the ensuing bloodshed, and the community felt mistreated in the new Hindu-majority nation, prompting some prominent leaders to advocate for the creation of Khalistan. Over the years, violent clashes have erupted between followers of the movement and the Indian government, claiming many lives.  In the 1980s, Punjab witnessed a decade-long insurgency by some Khalistani militants, who committed a series of human rights abuses, including the massacre of civilians, indiscriminate bombings and attacks on Hindus, according to Human Rights Watch.   In counterinsurgency operations, Indian security forces arbitrarily detained, tortured, executed, and \u201cdisappeared\u201d tens of thousands of Sikhs, the rights group said. The Indian government also enacted counterinsurgency legislation that facilitated human rights violations and shielded security forces from accountability for these violations, it added.  In 1984, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered Indian troops to storm Amritsar\u2019s Golden Temple \u2013 Sikhism\u2019s holiest shrine \u2013 to kill Sikh separatists, in an operation that caused huge anger within the Sikh community.  Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in the aftermath, prompting a renewed bout of violence that killed more than 3,000 people, mostly Sikhs.  A year later the violence spilled over to Canada, when Sikh separatists bombed an Air India plane that had taken off from Toronto airport, killing all 329 people aboard, including numerous Canadians of Indian descent. The Khalistan movement now There is no insurgency in Punjab today and analysts say supporters of the Khalistan movement remain very much on the margins in India.  However, the movement continues to evoke a level of sympathy from some Sikhs within the global diaspora, particularly in Canada, Britain and Australia. A small but influential number of those Sikhs support the idea of Khalistan, with referendums periodically held to reach a consensus to establish a separate homeland.  Nijjar\u2019s death shocked and outraged many within the Sikh community in Canada, which has more than 770,000 members and is one of the largest outside India. Canadian police have not arrested anyone in connection with Nijjar\u2019s murder.

Some 800 new active-duty personnel are being sent to the border, where 2,500 National Guard members already are serving, Department of Homeland Security officials announced Wednesday night in a call with reporters.  The move comes as migrant crossings along that border are rising, surpassing 8,600 over the last 24 hours, according to a Department of Homeland Security official. That\u2019s up from around 3,500 daily border arrests after the expiration in May of Title 42 triggered new consequences for those who cross the border illegally. There were than 8,000 apprehensions on Monday. The busiest sectors are Del Rio, El Paso, Lower Rio Grande Valley and Tucson \u2013 each facing more than 1,000 encounters over the last 24 hours, according to the official. Eagle Pass is in the Del Rio sector. The submerged body of a man believed to be a migrant was recovered by authorities near Eagle Pass Thursday morning, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Maverick County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The migrant, found under the water a couple hundred yards north of the Eagle Pass marine barrier, was in his 40s or 50s and likely drowned farther north within the past day, said Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber. Schmerber said the man did not have identification and authorities feel confident he was a migrant.  On Wednesday, a 3-year-old boy died as his family attempted to cross the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, according to a statement from the Texas Department of Public Safety.  The DPS Tactical Marine Unit was alerted that a child was swept away by the current while trying to cross the river with his family just after 3:30 p.m. local time.  Troopers brought the child to shore, and he was pronounced dead at a local hospital, according to DPS, which said the death occurred north of the marine barrier in Eagle Pass.   The overall influx in recent weeks has strained federal resources and overwhelmed already-crowded facilities, officials have said. Officials gave no clear explanation for what has prompted the latest surge and said they\u2019re still working through specific reasons. They continued to identify disinformation from smugglers, poor economies, authoritarian regimes and the climate crisis as forces driving migration. Many who leave their homes for the United States face long and dangerous treks in hopes of finding better, safer lives. Some may flee violence, while others may immigrate for economic opportunities or to reunite with family, experts say. Deteriorating conditions in Latin America exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic also have contributed to the influx of migrants into the US.  Recent court filings have underscored the challenges administration officials face in receiving the increased number of people arriving at the border, including crowded processing areas leading to children being temporarily separated from their parents. Since President Joe Biden took office, officials have set up additional soft-sided facilities similar to tent complexes to process the growing number of migrants crossing the border, but those facilities are not equipped to provide long-term care. Around 3,000 migrants crossed into the US near Eagle Pass on Wednesday alone, a source familiar with the situation told CNN. Hundreds waited in the city of around 28,000 about 150 miles southeast of San Antonio for transport to a processing facility and were moved out quickly, the source said. \u2018Some people are dying\u2019 Schmerber, the Maverick County sheriff, told CNN Thursday he believes cartels are helping drive the current surge of migrants in Eagle Pass, the county seat.  \u201cI mean they\u2019re making money with the immigrants. They\u2019re making money with the drugs,\u201d Schmerber said.  \u201cI know this because we have smugglers coming from Houston, Florida, Austin \u2013 everywhere to pick up these immigrants. There\u2019s a connection there.\u201d About 2,700 migrants crossed into the US near Eagle Pass on Tuesday, followed by another 3,000 on Wednesday, according to the sheriff.  \u201cIt\u2019s something very strange. Never thought I was going to see something like that in Eagle Pass,\u201d said Schmerber, an Eagle Pass native.  Schmerber said the border town doesn\u2019t have the facilities to sustain the influx. He called for a zero-tolerance policy to curb the surge. \u201cIt means you\u2019re arrested, processed, and deported right back to your country, just like that,\u201d Schmerber said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing from the federal government saying zero-tolerance. They\u2019re accepting immigrants.\u201d Biden administration officials have been grappling with a growing number of Venezuelans arriving to the US southern border. Frosty relations with Venezuela make it difficult for the US to remove those nationals arrested at the border, posing a unique challenge for officials. Schmerber, a Democrat, accused the Biden administration of sending a message that the border is \u201cgoing to be open.\u201d  \u201cSome people are drowning. Some people are dying,\u201d Schmerber said. \u201cSome of those ranchers are finding bodies or bones. So why take a risk? Why make those people come like this?\u201d  When Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas Jr. was asked about Schmerber\u2019s remarks regarding the responsibility of the Biden administration, Salinas said he hadn\u2019t heard from anyone in the administration.  \u201cNobody bothered to call me,\u201d Salinas said, adding he believes Biden does \u201cbear some responsibility for this crisis.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here, abandoned. We\u2019re on the border. We\u2019re asking for help. This is unacceptable.\u201d Salinas told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. On Thursday, a group of roughly 100 migrants from Venezuela stuck on the banks of the Rio Grande told CNN they were not willing to go back to Mexico because it was \u201ctoo dangerous.\u201d After crossing the river earlier, the group was stuck on the riverbank in Eagle Pass when rows of concertina wire prevented them from proceeding.  The migrants stood in the water and shouted through the wire, saying they had been robbed and attacked in Mexico. They said they wanted to wait on the banks until US authorities let them in. The group said they had been there for hours trying to figure out how to turn themselves in to federal authorities. One migrant told CNN they were willing to wait even if it meant they would be deported. Some told CNN they had been trying to enter the US via the legal process of requesting asylum and have waited months to get through the online application process.  Eagle Pass responds to migrant influx  Salinas noted his city is home to only about 30,000 residents so the daily influx of thousands of migrants has put the community in a \u201cvery serious situation.\u201d \u201cA lot of people are frustrated,\u201d Salinas told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Thursday evening.  Earlier this week, Salinas declared a state of emergency due to the sudden influx. \u201cWe have never seen this before,\u201d he said on why he decided to make the emergency declaration. \u201cThis is not normal, and we shouldn\u2019t have to be going through a situation like this in the United States.\u201d  Salinas noted the crossings have also had an economic toll on the community due to the closure of a bridge connecting Eagle Pass to Mexico. In the meantime, US Customs and Border Protection is temporarily suspending vehicle processing operations at a crossing in Eagle Pass \u201cin order to redirect personnel to assist the US Border Patrol with taking migrants into custody,\u201d the agency announced in a statement Wednesday.  \u201cIn response to this influx in encounters, we will continue to surge all available resources to expeditiously and safely process migrants,\u201d Customs and Border Protection said in the statement. \u201cWe will maximize consequences against those without a legal basis to remain in the United States.\u201d Border authorities in Eagle Pass processed the large influx of migrants on Wednesday in an \u201corderly way\u201d but warned the administration will \u201cimpose consequences\u201d on as many people as possible who crossed, Department of Homeland Security officials said. Consequences could include expedited removals and other penalties available under the Title 8 process.  The US military has long provided support to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the border and a surge of personnel to the area is not unprecedented, or unexpected, amid strains on federal resources. Troops have generally served in a support role rather than enforcement. Military personnel will not have direct contact with migrants, according to a Department of Defense spokesperson. The up to 800 additional personnel will, for 90 days, \u201cfill critical capability gaps, such as ground-based detection and monitoring, data entry, information analysis, transportation, and supply chain support, until DHS can address these needs through contracted support,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThis deployment is consistent with other forms of military support to DHS over many years.\u201d In May, ahead of the expiration of the Covid-era Title 42 restriction, US Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 8,000 people daily and had around 25,000 migrants in custody, raising alarm within the Biden administration.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T12:08:25Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921173320-india-womens-reservation-bill-celebration.jpg?c=original", "title": "India agrees to reserve a third of parliament seats for women. But the change could still take years", "content": "India\u2019s parliament passed a landmark bill Thursday that will reserve a third of its seats in the lower house and state assemblies for women, in a major win for rights groups that have for decades campaigned for better gender representation in politics. The bill received cross-party support and was celebrated by politicians across India\u2019s often fractious political spectrum but some expressed reservations that it could still take years for the quota to be implemented. A total of 214 lawmakers from the upper house voted in favor of the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, which was introduced by prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government in a special parliamentary session on Tuesday. It was approved by the lower house on Wednesday. \u201cA historic moment in our country\u2019s democratic journey!\u201d Modi wrote on Twitter after its approval. \u201cWith the passing of this bill, the representation of women power will be strengthened and a new era of their empowerment will begin.\u201d  Six attempts to pass the bill, first introduced in 1996, have failed, at times due to strong disapproval from the country\u2019s overwhelmingly male lawmakers.  In India, the world\u2019s largest democracy of 1.4 billion people, women make up nearly half of the country\u2019s 950 million registered voters but only 15% of lawmakers in parliament and 10% in state assemblies.  Despite being voted through, the move will not apply to next year\u2019s general election.  The implementation of the quota could take years as it depends on the redrawing of electoral constituencies, which will only happen after the completion of India\u2019s once-in-a-decade census.  That huge census project was meant to take place in 2021, but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic, and has been stalled ever since.  Some members of India\u2019s opposition expressed disappointment that the bill won\u2019t come into effect sooner.  Sonia Gandhi, a leader of the Indian National Congress, said women have been waiting for 13 years for the bill to go through.  \u201cNow they have been asked to wait longer,\u201d she told lawmakers in parliament. \u201cHow many years more?\u201d  Rajani Patil, another Congress lawmaker, said that while the party was \u201cvery happy\u201d at its passage, their demand is that the bill should be \u201cimplemented immediately\u201d for the general elections.  She added: \u201cIt should include OBC reservations as well,\u201d referring to India\u2019s caste system, a 2,000 year old social hierarchy imposed on people by birth. Though abolished in 1950, it still exists in many aspects of life.  Nonetheless, the bill\u2019s passage in parliament will be seen as a further boost to Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of national elections next year.  While India has made progress on women\u2019s issues in recent years, it remains a deeply patriarchal country. It has, since its independence in 1947, had one female prime minister. India Gandhi served as the country\u2019s leader twice before her assassination in 1984.  India\u2019s current President, Droupadi Murmu, who was appointed to the position last year became only the second woman to take the seat.  Across the world, the overall share of lower house parliamentary seats occupied by women is about 26 percent according to UN Women\u2019s data, up from 11 per cent in 1995.  Only six nations have currently achieved 50 per cent or more women in parliament in single or lower houses. Rwanda leads with 61 per cent, followed by Cuba (53 per cent), Nicaragua (52 per cent), Mexico (50 per cent), New Zealand (50 per cent), and the United Arab Emirates (50 per cent). A further 23 countries have reached or surpassed 40 per cent, including 13 countries in Europe, six in Africa, three in Latin America and the Caribbean, and one in Asia \u2013 Timor Leste. However Taiwan, which is not counted in the UN data, has the second highest representation of women in its legislature in Asia after the UAE at 43 percent.

Those two deputies, Stevon Jones and Courtney Parham, have been indicted by a grand jury on charges of second-degree murder and aggravated assault resulting in death for their alleged involvement in Freeman\u2019s death while incarcerated at Shelby County Jail in October 2022.  Seven other deputies were indicted on lesser charges related to Freeman\u2019s death.  Freeman\u2019s family has been calling for justice and accountability for months after surveillance footage revealed a violent encounter between Freeman, 33, and several deputies on October 5, 2022, which ultimately resulted in his death.  The footage, made public in March, shows several officers punching, kicking and using what appears to be pepper spray on Freeman as as they attempt to subdue him after he lunged at officers from inside his cell. Medical examiners found Freeman\u2019s cause of death to be exacerbation of \u201ccardiovascular disease due to physical altercation and subdual\u201d and that \u201cprobable psychotic disorder\u201d was likely a contributing condition. The family\u2019s attorney has said Freeman was under mental health observation while at the jail.  Jones and Parham did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. CNN has been unable to determine attorneys for the nine deputies.  Brice Timmons, an attorney for Freeman\u2019s family, said at a news conference the family is \u201cextremely pleased that the grand jury has returned indictments. They feel like the system might actually get some justice.\u201d  Freeman had been booked into jail a week before his death on charges of domestic violence related to aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault. In a fiery news conference Wednesday night, Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner, Jr. addressed the indictments and said \u201cthe way this case was being handled is political.\u201d Bonner is running for mayor of Memphis. Shelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy has endorsed one of Bonner\u2019s mayoral race opponents and has recused himself from the case of Freeman\u2019s death.  Mulroy said in a statement that his endorsement of Bonner\u2019s opponent, Van Turner, came before Freeman\u2019s death and before Bonner announced his candidacy. \u201cI stand with these officers,\u201d Bonner said Wednesday. \u201cI find this (prosecution) despicable.\u201d   Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who also represents the family, said the indictments come \u201cafter a long fight for justice in his name and reflects the fight for justice for so many who die in custody.\u201d The case is being prosecuted by District Attorney General Glenn Funk, whose jurisdiction includes Nashville, after Mulroy\u2019s recusal. Funk was appointed to the case by the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference.   A spokesperson for Funk has not returned inquiries from CNN about the case.    What the surveillance footage shows Edited surveillance camera footage from inside the jail, which was released by Funk, has fueled calls for justice for Freeman and his family. In the video, corrections officers are seen opening Freeman\u2019s cell as they are handing food to inmates. Freeman, who is naked, lunges at officers after the door opens.  Multiple officers try to restrain Freeman and are seen punching, kicking and using what appears to be pepper spray on Freeman.  Freeman\u2019s body appears to leave a trail of fluid on the floor as he moves into a different hallway. Twice, Freeman is seen on the floor clinging to a guard\u2019s leg before getting up and running away. After officers chase Freeman to another floor of the jail and try to subdue him, he appears to swing at an officer. Officers eventually restrain Freeman, in part by placing a knee on his back, and put handcuffs on him as he is on his stomach.  Minutes later, when officers try to lift Freeman, he appears limp and unresponsive. According to Timmons, the family attorney, Freeman was naked in his cell because he had been under mental health observation and was placed in a suicide watch cell. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is happening in America where law enforcement feels they can treat mental health issues like criminal issues. Especially if they are marginalized people of color. Especially if they are Black men,\u201d Crump said in March. Freeman\u2019s mother, Kimberly Freeman, has demanded justice for herself, her son and his daughter. \u201cWe have to see my son \u2013 her father \u2013 in a box. We didn\u2019t plan this.

The disgraced former South Carolina attorney, who was convicted in March of murdering his wife and son, pleaded guilty to nearly two dozen fraud and money laundering charges Thursday morning in a federal courtroom in Charleston. The plea is related to a scheme in which Murdaugh and a bank employee allegedly defrauded his personal injury clients and laundered more than $7 million of funds, according to an indictment. Murdaugh was accused of using the settlement funds for his \u201cpersonal benefit, including using the proceeds to pay off personal loans and for personal expenses and cash withdrawals.\u201d Murdaugh cried as he told the judge he was pleading guilty of his own free will. He said he was doing so because he was guilty of the crimes, but also so his son, Buster, could see him taking responsibility for his actions, as well as to help his victims heal, according to three attorneys present during the proceedings.  Murdaugh agreed to plead guilty to 22 charges in all: one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud; one count of bank fraud; five counts of wire fraud; one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and 14 counts of money laundering. The majority of the charges carry a maximum federal sentence of 20 years, though four of the charges carry a maximum sentence of 30 years.  US District Court Judge Richard Gergel accepted and signed the plea agreement between Murdaugh and federal prosecutors. Gergel will determine federal sentencing for Murdaugh at a later date. \u201cAlex Murdaugh\u2019s financial crimes were extensive, brazen, and callous,\u201d US Attorney Adair F. Boroughs said in a statement. \u201cHe stole indiscriminately from his clients, from his law firm, and from others who trusted him. The US Attorney\u2019s Office, the FBI, and SLED committed to investigating and prosecuting Murdaugh\u2019s financial crimes when they first came to light. Today marks our fulfillment of that promise.\u201d What the plea agreement says The agreement says that if Murdaugh cooperates and complies with the conditions of the plea agreement, the government attorneys agree to recommend to the court that any federal sentence he receives for these charges \u201cbe served concurrent to any state sentence served for the same conduct.\u201d The agreement does not have a sentence recommendation included in it, as written. Notably, the agreement requires Murdaugh \u2013 who admitted under oath that he had previously lied to the police \u2013 to tell the truth. \u201cThe Defendant agrees to be fully truthful and forthright with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies by providing full, complete and truthful information about all criminal activities about which he/she has knowledge,\u201d the agreement reads.  If he is found in any way to break this portion of the agreement, the agreement would be voided. Much of the agreement is focused on Murdaugh working with the government to repay victims and locate missing assets. The agreement says Murdaugh must pay restitution to his victims and requests he forfeit a total of $9 million in assets. Further, he must submit to a polygraph test, if requested by the government, and could be called to testify before other grand juries or in future trials. Attorney Justin Bamberg, who represents several of Murdaugh\u2019s victims in the financial crimes, criticized the plea agreement in a statement.  \u201cGiven the severity and callousness of his crimes, Alex Murdaugh should never receive any incentive-based deal from the government, be it federal or state, and we respectfully disagree with the federal government\u2019s voluntary decision to concede to a concurrent sentence in exchange for his guilty plea and agreement to \u2018cooperate,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe trust that the South Carolina Attorney General\u2019s Office will remain steadfast in its commitment to hold Murdaugh accountable and will give him no breaks and offer no incentives; that ship sailed years ago,\u201d he added. \u201cMurdaugh\u2019s victims are looking forward to seeing him receive the individual sentences he earned via his own individual criminal conduct towards each of them under South Carolina law.\u201d Bigger legal challenges ahead The fraud charges are just the latest legal problems for Murdaugh, the scion of a prominent and powerful family of local lawyers and solicitors in South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry. Murdaugh was convicted in March of murdering his wife Maggie and son Paul in 2021 at their sprawling estate, and he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Days after his conviction, Murdaugh\u2019s lawyers began the appeals process. However, earlier this month, his defense team filed a court motion to suspend the appeal, so they could request a new trial. The motion included bombshell allegations that the Colleton County Clerk of Court tampered with the jury.  The South Carolina attorney general has asked the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division to investigate the claims. Last week, South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson asked the court to order Murdaugh\u2019s defense team to correct their motion due to several \u201cprocedural defects.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s office didn\u2019t directly dispute the motion but noted the ongoing investigation has already \u201crevealed significant factual disputes\u201d that undermine the credibility of Murdaugh\u2019s claims. Murdaugh\u2019s attorney\u2019s responded to the state\u2019s request on Thursday, accusing prosecutors of attempting to delay the appeal suspension and prevent the defense from requesting a new trial. The defense attorneys argued the \u201cprocedural defects\u201d raised by prosecutors are not relevant to the filing and asked the court to \u201cexpeditiously grant\u201d a new trial. The South Carolina Court of Appeals has not yet issued a decision. In addition, the disbarred attorney remains entangled in several other state and federal cases in which he faces more than 100 other charges.  Murdaugh is set to stand trial in November on charges related to stolen settlement funds from the family of the Murdaughs\u2019 late housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield. They are the first of dozens of state charges he faces in alleged schemes to defraud victims of millions. The financial crimes he is accused of in the case include embezzlement, computer crime, money laundering and tax evasion.

The two companies\u2019 board of directors met on Thursday and approved a resolution for Nippon TV to acquire shares of Studio Ghibli, making it a subsidiary of the television network, the companies said in a joint statement. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. \u201cWith director Hayao Miyazaki now 82 years old and producer Toshio Suzuki also 75, Studio Ghibli has long been struggling with the issue of their successors,\u201d the statement said. Nippon TV will \u201cpermanently protect Studio Ghibli\u2019s \u2018craftsmanship\u2019 and brand values,\u201d and \u201cintends to honor Studio Ghibli\u2019s autonomy\u201d so it can \u201cfocus on filmmaking.\u201d  It added that Miyazaki\u2019s eldest son, himself an animation film director, had been \u201crepeatedly\u201d suggested as a possible successor to his father \u2014 but he had \u201cdeclined the idea, claiming that it would be difficult for him to take over Ghibli on his own and that it would be better to leave the future of Ghibli to someone else.\u201d  The future of the studio has been an open question for many years, with Miyazaki announcing his retirement in 2013 \u2014 prompting Suzuki, also a co-founder, to say at the time that the firm needed a transformation. Miyazaki is regarded by many as one of the world\u2019s greatest animators and an icon of Japanese popular culture, with his films having shaped the animation industry and won critical acclaim globally. He recently re-emerged from retirement for his final film, \u201cThe Boy and the Heron,\u201d which was released earlier this year.  The film took seven years to create, the companies said in the joint statement, adding that they were \u201cdeeply grateful\u201d to audiences and for the positive reviews so far.  Still, Studio Ghibli said, the question of a successor was an issue, and it considered \u201cmany different candidates.\u201d The search led to discussions with Nippon TV, with Suzuki spending \u201csome time\u201d with the Nippon TV CEO at a hot spring resort last year, where they agreed to the partnership. Nippon TV and Studio Ghibli have long worked together, with the former broadcasting Ghibli films on air, investing in Ghibli movie productions, and even helping fund the Ghibli Museum, the statement said.  Under the new arrangement, Nippon TV will become the largest Ghibli shareholder with 42.3% of the voting rights. Since its founding in 1985, Studio Ghibli has been known for its hand-drawn animation, sticking to old-school, painstaking frame-by-frame methods.  Each of its hits, from \u201cThe Wind Rises\u201d (2013) to \u201cPrincess Mononoke\u201d (1997) and \u201cHowl\u2019s Moving Castle\u201d (2004), features delicately rendered characters, exquisitely crafted environments and an effortless sensation of movement. At the helm through it all, Miyazaki has made numerous movies that fuse wild fantasy with more serious issues including environmentalism, feminism and anti-war messaging.  His 2001 epic \u201cSpirited Away\u201d brought him international fame, grossing a record-breaking $274 million worldwide and winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T03:20:31Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921161549-05-joe-biden-zelensky.jpg?c=original", "title": "Zelensky\u2019s mixed reception in Washington may be a taste of political storm to come", "content": "The blue-and-gold flag draped hero worship of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s last Washington trip, which stirred comparisons to Winston Churchill\u2019s wartime stand against Nazism, was a distant memory on Thursday. Nine months later, Zelensky was back in town and he and his hosts learned some jarring lessons about one another at a moment when a path to ultimate victory in the war against Russia seems increasingly distant. Zelensky got an abrupt preview of how Donald Trump\u2019s possible return to power after the 2024 election and how the ex-president\u2019s current sway over the ungovernable Republican-led House of Representatives could rupture the multi-billion dollar lifeline on which Ukraine\u2019s survival depends. And far from clearing a new $24 billion administration request to sustain Ukraine\u2019s war effort, the chaotic House failed again Thursday to even fund the defense of the United States, as a new attempt to pass a military appropriations bill foundered against hard-right opposition. For their part, Americans glimpsed the sapping impact of a brutal war on a leader who rallied stunning resistance to a Russian invasion but also shoulders the burden of months of death and sacrifice forced upon his people. At times, the comic actor turned wartime hero looked exhausted and unsmiling. In a CNN interview, he confessed the personal strain of his furtive life as Russia\u2019s top target. And in public appearances, Zelensky\u2019s patience sometimes frayed \u2013 especially when berating the United Nations for failing to protect its members from aggression. In a US capital that has undergone an ideological shift since he was last here just before Christmas 2022, it now takes more than quoting President Franklin Roosevelt and drawing allusions to 9/11, to woo lawmakers.  There\u2019s also a question of whether Zelensky\u2019s relentless efforts to shame the world into action might be reaching the point of diminishing returns. The pugnacious president might think so too judging by his multiple and poignant expressions of gratitude for previous help as polls show more Americans are skeptical of aid to Ukraine. He may need to develop new political skills to adapt to a vicious phase in American politics when Ukraine is being dragged into an impeachment saga for the second time and is a central general election issue. Zelensky\u2019s trip to the United States \u2013 whose democracy, while battered, is still a bulwark of free political systems around the world \u2013 was a mirror image of another journey made by Russian President Vladimir Putin last week to restock his own arsenal in a meeting with North Korean tyrant Kim Jong Un in Russia\u2019s Far East. A warm welcome in the Oval Office  Biden did his best to assure Zelensky of US constancy.  \u201cMr. President, the brave people in Ukraine, and that\u2019s not hyperbole, the people of Ukraine have shown an enormous bravery, enormous bravery,\u201d Biden told Zelensky in the Oval Office. \u201cTogether with our partners and allies, the American people are determined to see to all we can to ensure the world stands with you.\u201d Zelensky profusely thanked Biden for America\u2019s support to \u201ccombat Russian terrorism.\u201d And he also thanked the people of Poland after the government in Warsaw said it would stop arming Ukraine after a dispute over Ukrainian grain imports. Analysts in the US and Ukraine said the move was bound up in political tensions ahead of Poland\u2019s approaching election, and probably didn\u2019t augur a long-term rupture between the allies. Biden unveiled yet another US aid package for Ukraine worth $325 million that was expected to include more cluster munitions and air defense equipment, according to two US officials, marking the second time the US has provided the controversial weapon to Kyiv.  But there was also disappointment for Ukraine as national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the US will not be providing long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) \u2013 at least for now. The decision is the latest sign of the limitations of help even from Biden, who has led the Western alliance more effectively than any other US president since the end of the Cold War.  The president has constantly sought to balance US weapons offers against his underlying aim of avoiding a clash between NATO and nuclear superpower Russia, sparking a wider war. His hawkish critics however accuse him of slow walking weapons systems he eventually decides to provide, and of offering Ukraine only the means to ensure its survival but not to inflict a comprehensive defeat on Russia. Zelensky can return to Kyiv \u2013 which endured a fearsome Russian barrage overnight timed to coincide with his US visit \u2013 reassured that there is, at least for now, majority support in Congress for Ukraine\u2019s resistance.  Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell flanked him as he walked into a meeting with senators. The bipartisan meeting included an update on the war and Zelensky\u2019s efforts to fight corruption \u2013 one reason some Capitol Hill skeptics cite for cooling on massive aid grants. Zelensky\u2019s GOP backers in the Senate endorsed his efforts.  \u201cWe do know that Ukraine had problems with corruption \u2026 but we\u2019re also seeing parliament is taking that seriously,\u201d North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a member of the GOP leadership, said after the meeting. In December 2022, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi unfurled a giant Ukrainian flag behind a clearly moved Ukrainian president after he addressed a joint session of Congress.  On Friday, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy however failed even to emulate his Senate colleague McConnell by appearing publicly with Zelensky \u2013 though he did have his picture taken with him in a closed-door meeting, and Zelensky later told a small group of US editors, including from CNN, that McCarthy \u201csaid that they will be on our side \u2013 it\u2019s not simple \u2013 that they will support.\u201d The speaker, who is locked in a showdown with his most extreme conservative members that could shut down the government next week, explained that the chamber didn\u2019t \u201chave time\u201d for a joint session with the Senate to hear a speech from Zelensky. And he refused to commit to holding a vote on the $24 billion package for Ukraine and complained that Biden should be more concerned over immigration on the Southern border. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve got to get our fiscal house taken care of here in America. I\u2019m more than willing to look at that. But the one thing I know is that if the president\u2019s only focused on that, well, you\u2019ve just had 10,000 people come across the border, and he wants to ignore that,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI think there are priorities here.\u201d  Republican hostility on Ukraine aid   McCarthy leads a conference that includes many pro-Trump members who are mirroring the ex-president\u2019s hostility to sending more aid to Ukraine. Trump has vowed to end the war within 24 hours if he is the Republican nominee and wins the 2024 presidential election \u2013 a pledge likely to prove favorable to Putin, whom he has often tried to impress.  Support for Ukraine has also drawn a fault line across the 2024 GOP primary race. Former US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, for example, pushed back against criticism of support for Ukraine made in a campaign event in New Hampshire.  \u201cYou had a thug invade a pro-American freedom loving country,\u201d she said.  But Vivek Ramaswamy, a rising Republican candidate more in tune with the populist nationalism that pulses through the modern GOP, said he wouldn\u2019t \u201cmince words\u201d with Zelensky and said he\u2019d rebuke him on corruption, limits on free speech and religious freedom. The divides underscore the Republican Party\u2019s struggle for its own soul, between traditional conservatives and foreign policy hawks who back global democracy and the isolationist \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach that saw Trump cozy up to dictators like Putin while lambasting the Western alliance that Biden has reinvigorated to meet a new challenge from Moscow.  There is also personal antipathy from some Trump acolytes to Zelensky, who was on the other end of the line in the phone call that led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment over an attempt to coerce his government to investigate Biden. Remarkably, Ukraine is now at the center of another impeachment drama as Republicans investigate Biden over so far unproven claims he benefited financially from his son Hunter\u2019s business activities in the country. Pro-Trump senators also rejected Zelensky\u2019s pleas. Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance skipped the all-Senate meeting with Zelensky \u2013 and then used his characteristic olive-green military garb as a punchline in a debate over Schumer\u2019s decision not to enforce formal dress conventions.  \u201cLetting someone in the Senate chamber dressed like this really crosses the line,\u201d Vance wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, along with a picture of Zelensky who actually did not address senators in the chamber but in the smaller, old Senate chamber that is often used for ceremonial events.  Another senator from the pro-Trump wing of the GOP, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, described Zelensky as grateful and respectful. But he complained the Biden team had established no clear goal for winning the war.  \u201cThey don\u2019t know. They just want more money indefinitely,\u201d Hawley said. His comment underscores a sentiment often echoed by Republican voters that the US has thrown itself into an open-ended conflict \u2013 even if its troops are not involved. Trump exacerbates such concerns by warning that Biden\u2019s help for Ukraine could trigger World War III with Russia.  Skepticism about the administration\u2019s policy has also been fueled by the failure of Ukraine\u2019s long-awaited counter-offensive to break the back of Russia\u2019s invasion through territory that has been heavily mined.  Any hopes of a long-term peace deal are meanwhile undercut by Ukraine\u2019s determination to recover lost territory and Russia\u2019s history of ignoring ceasefires in the region. Putin also has incentives for keeping the war going: It is critical to his prestige and desire to recreate a greater Russia sphere of influence. He may also wait to see whether a power shift in the White House could see a returning President Trump keen to end the war on Russia\u2019s terms.  That all means Biden\u2019s assurances to stick with Zelensky for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d may not be as iron clad as they once seemed. With no end in sight for the biggest war in Europe since World War II, Ukraine\u2019s fate seems increasingly aligned with Biden\u2019s own political destiny.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T22:14:35Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921163740-huang-xueqin-file.jpg?c=original", "title": "China #MeToo journalist and labor activist expected to appear in secret trial as crackdown deepens", "content": "Two Chinese activists held without trial for the past two years are expected to appear before a judge in a closed doors hearing on Friday as the ruling Communist Party ramps up its effort to dismantle what remains of the country\u2019s civil society.  Independent journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin and labor rights activist Wang Jianbing were detained by authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou in September 2021.  The pair have been accused of inciting subversion of state power and will be tried at the Guangzhou Intermediate People\u2019s Court, according to supporters. Multiple calls to the court from CNN went unanswered on Friday. Rights advocates say Huang and Wang are unlikely to receive a fair trial in a judicial system controlled by the party with a conviction rate above 99.9%. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure what the substance of the Chinese government\u2019s case against Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing is, but we can be certain that the process will be a complete sham,\u201d said William Nee, a research and advocacy coordinator at Chinese Human Rights Defenders.  \u201cHuang has not seen a lawyer of her choice in two years of detention. They were both reportedly subjected to prolonged interrogations and police frequently would wake Huang up in the middle of the night and start interrogations,\u201d Nee said. CNN reached out to the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau which declined to give details on the case.   \u2018Isolated atoms\u2019 A close friend of Huang told CNN the journalist had suffered significant weight loss in detention and stopped menstruating for months. She also had other serious deficiencies and prolonged back pain, said the friend, who requested anonymity fearing retribution by authorities. The pair were detained the day before Huang, 35, was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom to start her master\u2019s degree on gender violence and conflict at the University of Sussex. Authorities have offered no details about their charges, but supporters believe it could be related to weekly friends\u2019 gatherings held at Wang\u2019s apartment. In the months following their detention, more than 70 friends and supporters of Huang and Wang were summoned by the police for questioning, according to supporters. Some were forced to sign fabricated testimonies against the pair, claiming they had organized political gatherings to criticize the government, the supporters claimed. Huang\u2019s close friend said participants of the gatherings were a loose group of friends who care about public affairs \u2013 from the issues of feminism, LGBTQ and labor rights to environmental protection. In addition to sharing their experiences and views, they also played board games and sometimes went hiking together. \u201cIt\u2019s a community where everyone supports each other. But it\u2019s been disbanded ever since the detention. I have no sense of belonging anymore,\u201d the friend told CNN. \u201cThe crackdown by authorities turned us into isolated atoms \u2013 it is difficult for everyone to band together again. The entire community is suppressed and silenced.\u201d \u2018Courageous wave of younger Chinese\u2019 Nee, at the Chinese Human Rights Defenders, said the real purpose of the case against them may be about dismantling of informal friendships and networks among civil society activists in Guangzhou. \u201cThe Chinese government has already effectively shut down independent NGOs roughly a decade ago, but it now appears that they want to go after even the informal solidarity that exists among free thinking people who could pose a potential political threat to the regime,\u201d he said. Huang, who worked as an investigative reporter for liberal-leaning media outlets in Guangzhou before becoming an independent journalist, had been an instrumental figure in sparking China\u2019s #MeToo movement.  In 2018, she helped bring about the country\u2019s first #MeToo case, using her influential social media presence to amplify the voice of a graduate student who accused her PhD supervisor of unwanted sexual advances. She also spoke up about her own experiences of sexual harassment as a young intern at a national news agency, where she claimed she was groped and kissed by a senior male reporter and mentor. To show the prevalence of the issue, she surveyed 416 female journalists in 2018 and found 84% of them had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. \u201cThere are so few people prosecuted because there are only so few victims who report,\u201d she told CNN in a 2018 interview. \u201cTo most victims, it\u2019s shame.\u201d Amnesty International described Huang and Wang as part of a \u201ccourageous wave of younger Chinese activists who have connected with the public concerned about social issues.\u201d \u201cThese baseless charges are motivated purely by the Chinese authorities\u2019 relentless determination to crush critical voices,\u201d said Sarah Brooks, Amnesty International\u2019s Deputy Regional Director for China.

In a notice Wednesday, the Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University in the capital city of Shaanxi province said students will no longer need to pass a nationwide standardized English test \u2013 nor any other English exams \u2013 to be able to graduate with bachelor\u2019s degrees. The announcement caused a stir on social media, with many praising the decision and calling for more universities to do the same. \u201cVery good. I hope other universities will follow suit. It\u2019s ridiculous that Chinese people\u2019s academic degrees need to be validated by a foreign language (test),\u201d said a comment with more than 24,000 likes on microblogging site Weibo, where a related hashtag attracted more than 350 million views Thursday. Passing the College English Test, a national standardized exam first held in 1987, has been a graduation requirement at the majority of Chinese universities for decades \u2013 although the government has never made it an official policy. The common practice underlined the importance Chinese universities placed on English \u2013 the world\u2019s predominant academic and scientific language \u2013 especially when the once-insular and impoverished country was opening up and eager to catch up with the developed world after the turbulence of the Mao Zedong era. But in recent years, some universities have downgraded the importance of English, either by replacing the national College English Test with their own exams or \u2013 as in the case of the Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University \u2013 dropping English qualifications altogether as a graduation criteria. \u201cEnglish is important, but as China develops, English is no longer that important,\u201d said a Weibo post from a nationalist influencer with 6 million online followers after the university\u2019s announcement.  \u201cIt should be the turn for foreigners to learn Chinese,\u201d the influencer said.  The downgrade comes as China turns more nationalist and inward under Xi, who has called on the country to strengthen \u201ccultural confidence\u201d and fend off \u201cWestern influence.\u201d In schools and universities, teachers have been forbidden from using Western textbooks or talking about \u201cWestern values\u201d such as democracy, press freedom and judicial independence. There has also been moves to downgrade English teaching in classrooms.  In Shanghai, China\u2019s most cosmopolitan city, authorities in 2021 banned elementary schools from holding final exams on the English language, citing the need to ease the academic burden on students. Some lawmakers and government advisers have also proposed to remove English as a core subject in schools and from the country\u2019s university entrance exams. In contrast, across the strait in Taiwan, the government has rolled out a plan for the island to be bilingual by 2030.   China made English a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools in 2001, the same year the country joined the World Trade Organization. At the time, the education ministry hailed the requirement as part of a national strategy to make Chinese education \u201cface modernization, face the world and face the future\u201d. For some liberal-leaning Chinese, the downgrade of English is symbolic of China\u2019s inward turn and a tightening of ideological control. \u201cWe should have cultural confidence, but it\u2019s not the same as being culturally arrogant, short-sighted or closed-minded,\u201d a comment on Weibo said. \u201cWe need English to understand the world. This is a fact and it cannot be covered up by the banner of nationalism,\u201d said another. Others cheered the scrapping of English tests at universities from a practical perspective, arguing it was a waste of time and energy as graduates seldom use the language in their daily life or career after graduation \u2013 and when they do, artificial intelligence and machine translation can help out anyway. But some disagreed, citing English\u2019s importance as the language for the world\u2019s leading academic journals, especially in science and technology. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to link it [to graduation], but don\u2019t underplay the importance of English. These days, if you don\u2019t understand English, you\u2019ll still fall behind in the scientific and technological world,\u201d a Weibo user said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T02:12:58Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230323140829-01-rupert-murdoch-file.jpg?c=original", "title": "Rupert Murdoch steps down as Fox and News Corp. chairman, sending shockwaves through media and politics", "content": "Rupert Murdoch, the powerful right-wing media mogul who built and oversaw one of the world\u2019s most influential news empires, announced Thursday that he will step down as chairman of his companies, Fox Corporation and News Corporation. \u201cFor my entire professional life, I have been engaged daily with news and ideas, and that will not change,\u201d Murdoch, 92, wrote in a memo to employees. \u201cBut the time is right for me to take on different roles, knowing that we have truly talented teams.\u201d As the leader of Fox and News Corporation, which publishes influential broadsheets such as The Wall Street Journal and tabloid New York Post, Murdoch has for decades commanded considerable influence in the Republican Party, matched by only a select few. His retirement comes at a key moment in the media industry as entrenched entertainment giants confront a sweeping transformation of the traditional television and film business and consumers rapidly gravitate toward streaming services. Murdoch\u2019s decision to step down as chairman of his companies will also send shockwaves through the political world, just as the 2024 presidential race heats up. Fox News remains ensnared in litigation stemming from the network\u2019s peddling of former President Donald Trump\u2019s election lies in the wake of the 2020 election. Lachlan Murdoch steps in Stepping into his shoes, Murdoch\u2019s eldest son, Lachlan, who already serves as chief executive of Fox Corporation, will become sole chairman of both companies. Murdoch described Lachlan as \u201ca passionate, principled leader.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if Fox\u2019s direction will change under Lachlan, but Rupert signaled that Lachlan will maintain the right-wing editorial bent his media companies are known for. \u201cMy father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,\u201d Murdoch told employees in his memo. \u201cSelf- serving bureaucracies are seeking to silence those who would question their provenance and purpose. Elites have open contempt for those who are not members of their rarefied class. Most of the media is in cahoots with those elites, peddling political narratives rather than pursuing the truth.\u201d Rupert Murdoch, who assured staffers he is in \u201crobust health,\u201d said that in his new role as chairman emeritus he would still be \u201cinvolved every day in the contest of ideas.\u201d However, Lachlan Murdoch has privately criticized Trump, saying that he disagrees with much of the way the former President behaves, people familiar with the matter told CNN last year. In some comments, Murdoch had gone as far as to tell people that he believes if Trump were to run again, it would be bad for the country. A storied, controversial career Murdoch\u2019s foray into the media business began in the 1950s with a small Australian newspaper chain,  In 1969, Murdoch landed his first major overseas prize with the purchase of the UK\u2019s News of the World. He went on to acquire The Sun and The Times and The Sunday Times of London, building a newspaper empire that gave him unrivaled reach and political influence in Britain. In 1973, Murdoch first entered the United States media sphere with the purchase of the San Antonio Express and the San Antonio News. A year later, he moved to New York and soon after began the National Star, a tabloid competing against the National Enquirer.  Perhaps one of his most prolific purchases was the New York Post in 1976, a punchy New York City tabloid that still dominates the media and political sphere today. He\u2019s owned it since then, except for a brief time when rules prohibited ownership of newspapers and TV stations in the same city. He bought it back in 1993 after selling it in 1988.  Murdoch became a major Hollywood executive in 1985 when he purchased Twentieth Century Fox from oilman Marvin Davis for $600 million. In 1986, Murdoch got into the television business after he purchased several US television stations and created Fox Broadcasting. He launched UK satellite pay-TV broadcaster Sky in 1989, before merging it with a major rival just a year later after a bruising price war. But his UK empire foundered two decades later as a consequence of a hacking scandal at the News of the World. Murdoch shut the Sunday tabloid \u2013 one of Britain\u2019s oldest and best-selling newspapers \u2014 in July 2011 amid public outrage over allegations that the outlet had illegally eavesdropped on murder and terror victims, politicians and celebrities. The scandal forced him to abandon a bid to take control of Sky.  He made another bid for the pay-TV broadcaster in 2016, but it became ensnared by UK media regulators who worried that the deal would give the Murdoch family too much influence in Britain and concerns over its commitment to uphold UK broadcasting standards. Comcast swooped in at the last minute and outbid Fox for Sky. Although he focused largely on print and TV, he did unsuccessfully try to dominate the internet too. He bought MySpace, one of the first social networks, in 2005 for $580 million. in 2011, he sold it for a substantial loss at $35 million. He later reflected that its failure was because of a \u201cseries of expensive lost opportunities\u201d with an addition of a \u201clayer of bureaucracy\u201d that halted progress against rivals like Facebook and YouTube. Murdoch sold much of his media empire, including the Twentieth Century Fox film studio, to Disney in a massive $71 billion deal in 2019. He was left with a much leaner broadcast portfolio, consisting of Fox News and Fox Sports. After that sale, however, he maintained his News Corp. newspaper business, including the Wall Street Journal, which was part of his company\u2019s Dow Jones purchase in 2007 for $5.6 billion. Under his purview, the broadsheet expanded its focus beyond money and markets, built a successful paywall and kept its down-the-middle tone except for its conservative Opinion page.   Fox News Fox News launched in 1996 as a conservative startup competitor to CNN. It eventually became the top cable news channel in America by playing into conservative narratives. The channel, however, veered from its roots in conservative news as former President Donald Trump ascended to power in the Republican Party in 2015, becoming an unabashed home of right-wing propaganda aimed at propping up the scandal-ridden White House. Murdoch-owned outlets also have a long history of undermining and down-playing climate science. In the US, Fox News has become a home to climate change conspiracy theories and the people who proliferate them. While Murdoch has said many times that he does not support climate denial, his outlets have continued to push climate doubt and platform climate skeptics. \u201cNobody has done more harm to the understanding of climate change than Rupert Murdoch, who has wielded his global media network as a weapon to sow doubt and confusion about the basic science and the case for action,\u201d Michael Mann, a renowned climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, told CNN. In recent years, under Murdoch, Fox News has advanced baseless conspiracy theories, including the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election. The lies Fox News pushed about the election spawned two massive defamation lawsuits from voting technology companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. Fox earlier this year settled the Dominion lawsuit for a historic $787.5 million. The Smartmatic lawsuit, however, continues to make its way through the court system. Fox News announced Murdoch\u2019s retirement on its air Thursday morning, with anchor Bill Hemmer praising the network\u2019s founder. \u201cRupert Murdoch created all of this and so much more across America and the globe,\u201d Hemmer said. \u201cHis life\u2019s work has left an indelible imprint on the global media landscape. His contributions are both innumerable and extraordinary and we thank him for letting us be a part of it all.\u201d \u201cWithout him, we would not be here,\u201d anchor Dana Perino added.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T13:05:52Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230919121539-02-us-detainees-091023.jpg?c=original", "title": "Inside the crucial final hours as American diplomats tackled last minute obstacles to bring five Americans imprisoned in Iran home", "content": "In the final hours as the United States closed in on a controversial but historic deal to bring five Americans deemed wrongfully detained in Iran home, Iranian officials threw up roadblocks, attempted to force the US government to make last minute concessions and even stalled the process minutes before the detainees were set to board a flight out of Tehran. CNN has learned new, behind-the-scenes details about the final few days and the obstacles American diplomats had to navigate as they sought to ensure a diplomatic breakthrough that had been years in the making did not fall apart in the crucial last stages. Senior State Department officials spoke to CNN about what happened on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive details.  According to the officials, acting US Special Envoy for Iran Abram Paley and Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens arrived in Doha on Saturday afternoon to coordinate with Qatari and Swiss officials on the logistics for the release of the five American detainees and two of their family members, which they anticipated would take place on Monday. The diplomatic relationship with Iran is incredibly tense and even though years of painstaking indirect negotiations had brought the process to an apparent finish line, the Americans had to contend with last minute efforts to stall and try to get more out of the US, despite the two sides having an agreed-upon deal. The Iranians even threatened not to include all five of the Americans in the release unless the US did more, the officials told CNN. But having come this far, the Americans made clear they were not going home without all five \u2013 it was a non-negotiable to the US and the Iranians relented. \u201cWe held our line and the Iranians backed down and we made it work,\u201d a senior State Department official said.   The US officials suggested the negotiators didn\u2019t see these Iranian attempts as a significant threat that could sink the deal, but rather as part of a typical strategy by Tehran.  \u201cThey\u2019re always just trying to throw sand in the gears, always trying to negotiate and try to get more and more,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a very firm line and a very principled position, so we stood firm.\u201d  Still, \u201ceach hour there was something new that the Iranians were trying to stall with or just be difficult for the sake of being difficult,\u201d they added. Hurdles on the day of departure The Americans felt confident that the deal itself was enticing enough that Iran wouldn\u2019t actually walk away and that it was strong enough that they couldn\u2019t renege on it and still get what they wanted. Under the agreement, $6 billion in Iranian funds were transferred from restricted accounts in South Korea to restricted accounts in Qatar to be used for humanitarian purchases, and the US would release five Iranians from US custody. The last of the Iranian funds reached the bank accounts in Qatar on Monday, and the US had coordinated with the Qatari officials to notify Iran that the funds had arrived, which would then set off a sequence of steps to lead to the release. There was a delay, however, because the Iranian officials \u201ccouldn\u2019t find the head of the Central Bank to sign some letter that they had to transmit throughout their interagency to then authorize people to let them leave the hotel and go to the airport to pave the way for everything,\u201d the senior State Department official told CNN. But the money arrived, and everything seemed set. But nothing in this process was simple and even in the hours before the freed Americans were set to board a Qatari jet from Iran to Doha, Iranian officials were still trying to cause delays, the officials told CNN. The Iranians tried to insist that everyone, the released prisoners and diplomats from all sides, have lunch at the airport in Tehran before departing. But the Qatari officials, in a smooth diplomatic maneuver, countered that they would be offended if everyone did not eat while on board the Qatari plane and an agonizing final delay was avoided.  Having navigated the series of late hurdles, the Qatari plane carrying Siamak Namazi, Morad Tahbaz, Emad Shargi, and two other freed detainees whose names are not publicly known, as well as Namazi\u2019s mother, Effie, and Tahbaz\u2019s wife, Vida, took off from Tehran shortly before 9 a.m. ET on Monday. When they landed in Doha, the Americans were greeted by Carstens and Paley, who gave them their own personal cell phones to call their family members, whose numbers were already in the phones.  They also received a call from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who spoke to each of them individually for more than 10 minutes, according to officials. Blinken said on Monday that it was \u201can emotional conversation.\u201d The State Department, without offering too many details or trying to raise their hopes too high, had given the family members a heads-up late last week that they should consider making their way to the Washington, DC, area. They were in very regular contact with the families after that, and President Joe Biden called them on Monday morning after their loved ones were released. The department had solidified their plans to bring the returned Americans to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, about 10 days prior to the release, another US official told CNN, and staff from the Defense Department\u2019s Post Isolation Support Activities (PISA) program flew in to be ready to help. All of the returned Americans agreed to take part in the program. On Monday afternoon, shortly after 1 p.m. ET, the US plane carrying the seven Americans, Carstens, Paley and other US officials departed Doha en route to the US. In an interview with \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Tuesday, Carstens said the flight home was \u201cvery emotional,\u201d as the Americans got to interact for the first time without being surveilled by Iranian authorities. And early Tuesday morning, the plane touched down at Fort Belvoir. The Americans stepped off the plane, onto US soil, and into the arms of their loved ones, who carried small US flags that they had brought.   \u201cWe\u2019re home,\u201d Shargi said after embracing his daughters. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T01:49:29Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922090946-cisco-headquarters-0814.jpg?c=original", "title": "Cisco taps new M&A firm Tidal for $28 billion Splunk acquisition deal", "content": "A new mergers and acquisitions advisory firm launched last year by former Centerview Partners dealmakers has scored a big win by advising Cisco Systems on its $28 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Splunk.

McCormick enters this race as the front-runner for the Republican nomination and, according to GOP donors and officials, is expected to be a formidable challenger to Casey, who won a third term in 2018 with more than 55% of the vote.  Last year, McCormick attempted to secure the GOP nomination for the state\u2019s other Senate seat but lost to television doctor Mehmet Oz, who went on to lose the general election to Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, expanding Democrats\u2019 majority in the Senate.  McCormick referenced that record in his speech, saying, \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to lose a big match and walk off the mat. And I know what it\u2019s like to get fired from a job. And I know what it\u2019s like to lose a big election \u2013 you may have heard something about that. But each and every time, I picked myself up. I dusted myself off.\u201d Speculation that McCormick would run again began shortly after his last campaign had officially ended. In late May, McCormick announced that he was \u201cseriously considering a run\u201d in a statement released shortly after Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a fervent election denier and the losing 2022 GOP nominee for governor, said he would not enter the contest. During Thursday speech, McCormick seemed to signal his intent to run a campaign with broader, bipartisan appeal \u2013 he vowed to \u201cearn the votes of all citizens of this great commonwealth, regardless of their party.\u201d He made no mention of the culture war clashes that have animated many Republican campaigns in recent cycles. Throughout the speech, McCormick repeatedly tied Casey to Biden, and argued that the senator has been in Washington, DC, too long.  \u201cHe\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s rubber stamp. When Joe Biden says jump, Bob Casey says, how high? When Joe Biden says vote, Bob Casey says, which way? When Joe Biden comes calling, Bob Casey comes running,\u201d he said. \u201cNow here\u2019s the problem with rubber stamps \u2013 rubber stamps leave the southern border open, right? Rubber stamps expose the people of this commonwealth to rising crime, and a fentanyl crisis. Rubber stamps vote for trillions of dollars of spending, like Senator Bob Casey did when he voted for the Biden Inflation Creation Act. \u201d  With Democrats holding a narrow Senate majority, defending seats like Casey\u2019s will be key to the party maintaining control of the chamber. Democrats hold most of the competitive Senate seats on the ballot next year, including six in states that have voted for Trump at least once, Pennsylvania being one of them.  Casey \u2013 who is not expected to face a serious challenge in the Democratic primary \u2013 announced his reelection campaign in April. The son of a former governor, he has long been a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, previously serving as state auditor general and treasurer.

A McCormick strategist pushed back on that criticism in a call with reporters ahead of the announcement. \u201cDave is a divorced dad [and] he has a daughter in Connecticut who is in high school,\u201d the strategist said, stressing that McCormick grew up in the commonwealth and spent a \u201chuge chunk of his life here.\u201d  Pennsylvania is currently scheduled to hold primary elections on April 23, but state lawmakers are looking to change the date to avoid a conflict with Passover.

A judge approved the settlement on Tuesday. It was filed in the Henrico County Circuit Court, according to documents obtained by the Richmond Times-Dispatch.  The family of 28-year-old Irvo Otieno sued the commonwealth of Virginia, Henrico County and the Henrico County Sheriff after his death in March, which the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Virginia ruled a homicide by asphyxiation. Otieno\u2019s family has said he was in the midst of a mental health crisis when he was being processed at the hospital. Seven sheriff\u2019s deputies and one hospital worker still face pending trials for second-degree murder charges in the case. They have not yet entered pleas.    Henrico County police officers first encountered Otieno on March 3 after they responded to a possible burglary and placed him under an emergency custody order. Under Virginia law, a person may be placed under an emergency custody order if there are concerns they may harm themselves or others as a result of mental illness. The officers took Otieno to a hospital, where authorities said he became \u201cphysically assaultive\u201d towards officers. Police took him to Henrico County Jail and he was booked. He was transferred to the mental health facility in Dinwiddie County on March 14 and died during the intake process after he became \u201ccombative,\u201d according to the state\u2019s attorney.  Surveillance video showed multiple security officers pinning Otieno to the ground for 12 minutes. Additional video showed he had previously been kept in a holding cell at the Henrico County Jail, where he was naked and pepper-sprayed by deputies, according to prosecutors.  As part of the settlement agreement, the defendants are not admitting any liability and deny their actions caused Otieno\u2019s death, but agree to pay $8.5 million.  \u201cHenrico County continues to offer its heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Otieno,\u201d Ben Sheppard, a spokesperson for Henrico County, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cA claim brought by the family of Irvo Otieno against Henrico County, the Henrico County Sheriff and the Commonwealth of Virginia has been resolved.\u201d  Sheppard declined to provide further comment, citing a confidentiality agreement as part of the settlement. The Henrico County Sheriff\u2019s Office has not yet responded to a request for comment.  Otieno family lawyers Ben Crump and Mark Krudys said the family was \u201cpleased that they were able to find a resolution outside of court in a manner that honors Irvo\u2019s life,\u201d the statement reads. Macaulay Porter, a spokesperson for Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, called Otieno\u2019s death a \u201cprofound tragedy.\u201d  \u201cThe Governor pushed for a settlement with the hope that doing so proactively and fairly might alleviate \u2013 in a small way \u2013 some of the suffering that Irvo\u2019s mother and brother faced, recognizing that no settlement can take the place of a loved one,\u201d the statement reads.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T23:25:00Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230920123443-cassidy-hutchinson-file.jpg?c=original", "title": "Former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson claims Rudy Giuliani groped her on day of attack on Capitol", "content": "Cassidy Hutchinson, the former Trump White House aide, claims in a new book that Rudy Giuliani groped her backstage at the rally that preceded the former president\u2019s supporters\u2019 insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.  The 27-year-old Hutchinson, whose bombshell testimony provided a key moment in last year\u2019s public hearings of the House select committee that investigated the events of January 6, details her time in former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and afterward in a book titled \u201cEnough\u201d set to publish next week.  Quotes from the book, first reported by The Guardian, were confirmed by CNN. Hutchinson, an assistant to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, writes that Giuliani put his hands \u201cunder my blazer, then my skirt,\u201d at the January 6 rally.  Giuliani political adviser Ted Goodman in a statement called Hutchinson\u2019s claims a \u201cdisgusting lie.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s fair to ask Cassidy Hutchinson why she is just now coming out with these allegations from two and a half years ago, as part of the marketing campaign for her upcoming book release,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThis is a disgusting lie against Mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2014a man whose distinguished career in public service includes taking down the Mafia, cleaning up New York City and comforting the nation following September 11th.\u201d Publisher Simon & Schuster said in a statement, \u201cWe stand behind our author and her book.\u201d Backstage on Jan. 6 Hutchinson writes that the encounter with Giuliani was observed by others including John Eastman, a conservative attorney who, like Giuliani, advanced false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.   The encounter began, she writes, with Giuliani claiming to possess evidence of voter fraud. \u201cThe corners of his mouth split into a Cheshire cat smile. Waving a stack of documents, he moves towards me, like a wolf closing in on its prey,\u201d Hutchinson writes. \u201c\u2018We have the evidence. It\u2019s all here. We\u2019re going to pull this off.\u2019 Rudy wraps one arm around my body, closing the space that was separating us. I feel his stack of documents press into the small of my back. I lower my eyes and watch his free hand reach for the hem of my blazer,\u201d Hutchinson writes. \u201c\u2018By the way,\u2019 he says, fingering the fabric, \u2018I\u2019m loving this leather jacket on you.\u2019 His hand slips under my blazer, then my skirt.\u201d \u201cI feel his frozen fingers trail up my thigh,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe tilts his chin up. The whites of his eyes look jaundiced. My eyes dart to John Eastman, who flashes a leering grin.\u201d \u201cI fight against the tension in my muscles and recoil from Rudy\u2019s grip \u2026 filled with rage, I storm through the tent, on yet another quest for Mark,\u201d she writes, a reference to her then-boss Meadows. Charles Burnham, a lawyer for Eastman, categorically denied Hutchinson\u2019s account and in a statement to CNN called the accusations \u201clibelous.\u201d  Burnham\u2019s statement said that Eastman \u201cdoes not recall ever having met Ms. Hutchinson, and did not even know who she was until her public testimony before the Select Committee in the House of Representatives in June 2022.\u201d   Giuliani\u2019s legal issues Hutchinson\u2019s claims come as Giuliani faces a series of legal issues, including millions of dollars in mounting legal bills. The former New York City mayor is one of 18 co-defendants who were indicted alongside Trump in August by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis for their alleged role in attempting to interfere with the 2020 election results in Georgia. Giuliani had to post bond as he awaits trial \u2013 another costly venture. A law firm that represented Giuliani in recent years, Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, is also suing him, claiming Giuliani had paid only $214,000 of his total legal bill, leaving him owing the firm more than $1.3 million.  Giuliani has also been found liable for defaming two Georgia election workers who say they were falsely accused by Giuliani of committing voter fraud in 2020.  Trump\u2019s PAC recently paid off more than $300,000 Giuliani owed to a data-hosting company who kept access to some of his electronic data that he\u2019s needed to produce in litigation, and may need to pay thousands more to the company. He also faces more than $100,000 in sanctions for failure to respond to parts of the 2020 election defamation lawsuit and is awaiting a jury trial on potentially significant damages in that case.  Trump has promoted fundraisers for Giuliani\u2019s legal defense fund.

The divide between the two parties is not surprising given the polling data on Zelensky specifically and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine more broadly.  Republicans, it turns out, have become far more dovish on that conflict and in how they view the United States\u2019 role in the world more generally.  It may be hard to imagine now but Zelensky was once admired on both sides of the political aisle. At the beginning of the war, Zelensky sported a 77% favorability rating among Democrats and a 61% favorability rating among Republicans, according to a March 2022 Quinnipiac University poll. Just 6% of Republicans and 2% of Democrats viewed him unfavorably.  Since then, however, the tone from Republican leaders has soured. Whether these officials are guiding their voters or merely following them, the poll numbers have shifted significantly.   A July 2023 Gallup poll found that Zelensky\u2019s favorability rating with Republicans had declined to 51%. His unfavorability rating, meanwhile, had skyrocketed to 41%. This meant his net favorability with Republicans went from +55 points to +10 points in a little over a year.  Democratic leaders have been far more supportive of the Ukrainian leader, which could be why their voters have largely stayed that way too. Zelensky\u2019s favorability rating among Democrats was 75% in July, according to the Gallup poll \u2013 similar to the 77% in 2022, per Quinnipiac. While his unfavorability rating had ticked up, it still remained low at 11%.  The views toward Zelensky are emblematic of how Americans feel about the US involvement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict as a whole.  Back in early 2022, an Ipsos KnowledgePanel survey showed that 7% of Republicans and 6% of Democrats believed the US should be doing less. Majorities on both sides thought the US should be doing more or the same as they were doing.  Flash forward to today, it\u2019s a whole new world.  According to an August 2023 Fox News poll, a clear majority of Republicans (56%) agree that American should be doing less for Ukraine to help that country in its conflict with Russia. That\u2019s a nearly 50-point rise from where we were at the beginning of the war. Just 41% believe we should be doing more or the same amount, which is a 27-point drop from a little over a year ago.  The Democratic numbers have stayed mostly steady, just like on the question about Zelensky specifically. Most Democrats (83%) argue we should be doing more or the same amount to help Ukraine, which isn\u2019t much different from the 76% who wanted more or the same American involvement in the war in 2022. A small minority (14%) of Democrats say America should be doing less.  Republicans\u2019 less charitable views toward Zelensky and American involvement in his nation\u2019s war with Russia are not a sign of them taking Russia\u2019s side. In fact, Russia\u2019s favorability rating among Republicans \u2013 and Democrats \u2013 has declined significantly from a few years ago.  Just 6% of both Republicans and Democrats hold a favorable view of Russia in 2023, per Gallup polling, which is down from 25% and 16%, respectively, in 2021. Overall, 9% of Americans hold a favorable view of Russia \u2013 the lowest measure since 1989, when Gallup first asked about favorability ratings for the Soviet Union.   What\u2019s really going on here is that Republicans\u2019 dovish turn toward the Ukraine-Russia conflict isn\u2019t happening in a vacuum. It\u2019s part of a larger yearning of some Republicans wanting to move the country off the world stage, according to Gallup.  In 2023, 61% of Republicans want America to take a leading or major role in world affairs. That\u2019s the lowest level this century and a big dip from the 87% who felt that way 20 years ago.  Democrats, on the other hand, have remained mostly steady over that stretch. In both the 2003 and 2023 Gallup polling, 75% of Democrats agreed that America should take a leading or major role in world affairs.  This trendline may come as a bit of surprise given how hawkish Republicans were at the beginning of this century. In some ways, though, they could be following the long historical arc. For example, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say that the Korean War was \u201cuseless,\u201d according to a 1951 Gallup poll.  The truth is that coalitions in politics change and change again. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Democrats and Republicans trade worldviews again 20 years from now.

Earlier, BLS International stated on its website that India had suspended visa services for Canadian citizens from Thursday, citing a notice from the Indian mission. The notice was briefly removed on Thursday before reappearing again, without explanation.  India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs said \u201csecurity threats\u201d faced by the Indian High Commission and consulates in Canada led to the temporary measure of halting visa issuance across all categories.  \u201cThe issue is of incitement of violence, the inaction by the Canadian authorities, the creation of an environment that disrupts the functioning our high commission and consulates, that\u2019s what\u2019s making us stop temporarily the issuance of visas or providing visa services,\u201d the ministry\u2019s spokesman, Arindam Bagchi, said.  \u201cWe have always believed that it is the host government\u2019s responsibility to provide security,\u201d he told reporters in New Delhi on Thursday.

New Delhi has vehemently denied the allegations, calling them \u201cabsurd and motivated.\u201d  India\u2019s foreign ministry said Canada has provided \u201cno specific information\u201d to support Delhi\u2019s alleged involvement in Nijjar\u2019s death.  \u201cLet me also point out that from our side, very specific evidence of criminal activities by individuals based on Canadian soil has been shared with the Canadian authorities on a regular basis but not been acted upon,\u201d Bagchi, the ministry\u2019s spokesman, said.   Bachi added that he expects Canada\u2019s diplomatic presence in the country to be reduced.  On Thursday, Trudeau called on India to work with Canada and \u201callow justice to follow its course.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that India is a country of growing importance and a country that we need to continue to work with not just in the region but around the world,\u201d Trudeau told reporters at a press conference at the Canada Mission in the United Nations.    He said Canada \u201cis not looking to provoke or cause problems,\u201d but reiterated \u201cthe importance of the rule of law.\u201d   Trudeau\u2019s allegation has sent relations between the two countries into a tail spin, with both India and Canada expelling senior diplomats in reciprocal moves, raising the prospect of an awkward rift between key partners of the United States.  Nijjar was an outspoken supporter of the creation of a separate Sikh homeland known as Khalistan, which would include parts of India\u2019s Punjab state.  The Khalistan movement is outlawed in India and considered a national security threat by the government. A number of groups associated with the movement are listed as \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d under India\u2019s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Nijjar\u2019s name appears on the Home Ministry\u2019s list of UAPA terrorists and in 2020, the Indian National Investigation Agency accused him of \u201ctrying to radicalize the Sikh community across the world in favor of the creation of \u2018Khalistan,\u2019\u201d adding that he had been \u201ctrying to incite Sikhs to vote for secession, agitate against the government of India and carry out violent activities.\u201d According to local police, he was gunned down in his truck in June by two masked killers outside a Sikh temple in Surrey, British Columbia. His death both shocked and outraged the Sikh community in Canada, one of the largest outside India and home to more than 770,000 members of the religious minority. Canadian police have not arrested anyone in connection with Nijjar\u2019s murder. But in an August update, police released a statement saying they were investigating three suspects and issued a description of a possible getaway vehicle, asking for the public\u2019s help.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T04:14:23Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921155240-us-aid-what-matters.jpg?c=original", "title": "$113 billion: Where the US investment in Ukraine aid has gone", "content": "Days after President Joe Biden declared unyielding support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia, the domestic US political fight is threatening aid funding \u2013 and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky encountered less-than-open arms from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. Poland also announced this week it would no longer arm its neighbor Ukraine. Read more from CNN\u2019s Rob Picheta about that surprise development, which is born of a looming election in Poland and a standoff with the European Union over Ukraine\u2019s grain supply. Back in the US, for the clearest example of how the ground has shifted, watch the video below: a side-by-side comparison of comments from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was the Republican minority leader in March 2022 when Zelensky addressed a joint session of Congress virtually. The Ukrainian leader spoke again to all US lawmakers in person in December. The House was united, McCarthy said last March, \u201cto help Ukraine get the weaponry they need to defend themselves.\u201d  Now, after Congress committed so many billions in aid to Ukraine during votes in one calendar year and a US election catapulted him to House speaker, McCarthy has questions about accountability and further funding.  And rather than again give Zelensky the platform of a joint session before Congress, McCarthy gave Zelensky a meeting behind closed doors. Those optics, or lack thereof, are important. Money is the main topic of conversation on Capitol Hill at the moment  The US government is about to run out of funding and a government shutdown is on the horizon.  In August, as part of a larger request that included domestic disaster relief funding, the White House asked Congress to approve another $24 billion for Ukraine. This money would go to a variety of things, including replenishing the Pentagon\u2019s arsenal with equipment sent to Ukraine.  The most recent short-term funding bill pushed by Republicans included neither the disaster funding nor the Ukraine funding. But negotiations continue.  The existing Ukraine aid was all approved before Republicans took control of the House in a series of spending bills over the course of 2022. It has been spent in multiple disbursements by the Biden administration across the intervening months. The US has given more to Ukraine than any other country The total dollar figure the US has provided to Ukraine dwarfs any other individual country. However, the US is a much wealthier country than those that surround Ukraine, which suggests other countries may have given a larger comparative amount.  How much has the US agreed to spend on Ukraine? So far, Congress has approved about $113 billion in aid to Ukraine, according to calculations by the US State Department Office of Inspector General and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.  That includes more than $62 billion intended to go through the Pentagon and more than $46 billion intended to go through the Department of State and the US Agency for International Development.  What\u2019s $113 billion to the US government? To place the $113 billion appropriated by Congress for Ukraine in 2022 in context, that\u2019s a little more than it spends in one year on the Department of the Interior and a little less than it spends on the Department of Commerce, according to official government tallies.  The larger Pentagon budget is authorized to be $886 billion next year. The US also spends trillions each year on its safety net with programs like Social Security and Medicare. The largest chunk has gone directly to help Ukraine\u2019s military The US has actually spent a bit more than $43 billion on security aid for Ukraine since Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022.  The figure pops up to more than $44 billion during the Biden administration and more than $46 billion since 2014, when Russia first seized portions of Ukraine, according to the State Department.  What does the military funding buy? A lot of firepower. Start with 300 million rounds of ammunition and millions of artillery rounds. The Pentagon and State Department have a list of what the billions in US aid have gone to since Biden took office.  It includes 198 Howitzers for those millions of artillery rounds; 31 Abrams tanks; hundreds of Bradley infantry fighting vehicles; hundreds of armored personnel vehicles; anti-tank systems like the Javelin; NASAMS (national advanced surface-to-air missile systems) and HAWK air defense systems; river patrol boats; medical supplies; night vision devices; cold weather gear; and spare parts. Pretty much everything you could imagine short of F-16 fighter jets, which are to be provided by other countries. What does non-military spending provide? It\u2019s used for a very wide variety of things, according to the review by CRFB \u2013 everything from helping provide food security to helping rebuild Ukraine\u2019s infrastructure. Does the money go where it\u2019s supposed to? There have been indications of corruption. Zelensky, for instance, replaced the leadership at his defense ministry just before traveling to the US to address the United Nations and appear at the White House with Biden. CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria asked Zelensky how he would stop corruption. Zelensky argued money from partners like the US was not involved in the case of the defense minister \u2013 but that answer will not quiet calls in the US for more transparency and accountability. Has it been a good investment? Russia failed to overrun Ukraine, and in fact, Ukraine has launched a counteroffensive to retake territory from Russia. It has been slow going, but Ukraine has claimed new inroads this week in its effort to beat Russia back.  Experts say that without continued financial support, Ukraine would have trouble continuing to stand up to Russia. What do the people think? CNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that multiple recent surveys suggest Republicans would like to see the US scale back its support of Ukraine.  Much of the public overall continues to favor actions such as sanctions against Russia and help with Ukrainian intelligence gathering.  A CNN poll released earlier this summer charted growing Republican opposition to aid in Ukraine, and found 55% of the full public opposed to Congress authorizing more funding to support Ukraine, rising to 71% among Republicans. A majority of the public overall did favor some specific forms of aid, such as help with intelligence gathering (63% support) and military training (53% support). Polling from other organizations this fall has confirmed this shift. Divides within the GOP The CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Wednesday helps further demonstrate the divides on Ukraine within the GOP, according to Edwards-Levy.  It finds 59% of likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire support stopping all military funding for Ukraine, with 29% opposed and the rest neutral or unsure. An 84% majority of those backing former President Donald Trump in the primary favor cutting off aid to Ukraine, far higher than the level of support for this proposal among the rest of the GOP electorate (39%).", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T21:51:37Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921115040-cnn10-sept-22-air-pollution.jpg?c=original", "title": "Today\u2019s news in 10 minutes", "content": "September 22, 2023 Today on CNN10, we\u2019ll learn about how wildfire smoke is affecting our air quality and our health.

Todd Holmes, an associate professor of entertainment media management at Cal State Northridge, points to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics (BLS), which recorded a drop of 34,800 employees in the motion picture and sound recording industries between May and August. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that a lot of that is due to the strikes,\u201d Holmes says, adding that there could be more strike-related losses recorded in other BLS categories, including those in makeup, catering, custodial work, and other businesses that support productions. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real mess, and it just gets worse each day as the strikes continue,\u201d he added. Many job losses are from entertainment industry adjacent businesses like History for Hire, a prop shop whose owner, Pam Elyea, feels the ripple effect on those that rely on the entertainment industry. Elyea\u2019s company works to dress the sets of movies, TV shows, commercials and music videos, renting out everything from sports equipment to battle gear for period pieces. Before the strike, she says her 33-thousand square foot warehouse was \u201cextremely hectic\u201d with phones ringing and a staff of 15 to 20 moving orders of props in and out. Now, she\u2019s had to cut half her staff because demand is drying up. The remaining staff members switched to a California workshare program this week, where they work reduced hours, receive partial unemployment benefits, while maintaining health insurance. \u201cI would have people in and out here, I would have swing guys come and pull orders,\u201d Elyea tells CNN, looking at just a few items on carts in her warehouse awaiting pick-up. \u201cWe\u2019d be boxing stuff, we\u2019d be on the phones, the phone would be ringing, I would have twice the staff that I have right now. It would be extremely hectic.\u201d The ongoing strike is taking an emotional toll on Elyea, who says History for Hire has been in business for forty years. \u201cI\u2019m the one who worries at night,\u201d a choked-up Elyea tells CNN. \u201cYou don\u2019t lay somebody off without thinking, I\u2019m not just taking their job, they\u2019re gonna lose their home, they\u2019re gonna lose their apartment because nobody makes enough to, to live in Los Angeles. This is an extremely expensive city to live in.

He said YouTube is trying to bring \u201cthese powerful tools\u201d to the masses. The video platform, under the Alphabet-Google umbrella, teased a new generative AI feature dubbed Dream Screen specifically for its short-form video arm and TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts. Dream Screen is an experimental feature that lets creators add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to their vertical videos. To use Dream Screen, creators can type their idea for a background as a prompt and the platform will do the rest. A user, for example, could create a background that makes it look like they are in outer space or on a beach where the sand is made out of jelly beans, per demos of the tool shared on Thursday.  Dream Screen is being introduced to select creators and will be rolled out more broadly next year, the company said. YouTube also unveiled new AI-powered tools that creators can access to help brainstorm or draft outlines for videos or search for specific music using descriptive phrases. YouTube said it was bringing an AI-powered dubbing tool that will let users share their videos in different languages. Alan Chikin Chow, 26, a content creator based in Los Angeles who recently hit 30 million subscribers on YouTube, told CNN that he is most excited about using the new AI-powered dubbing tool for his comedy videos. Chikin Chow currently boasts the title of the most-watched YouTube Shorts creator in the world. \u201cI think global content is the future,\u201d Chikin Chow told CNN. \u201cIf you look at the trends of our recent generation, the things that have really impacted and moved culture are ones that are global,\u201d he added, citing the Korean smash-hit TV series \u201cSquid Game\u201d as one example.   Using the AI-powered dubbing features, he said he hopes to reach audiences in new corners of the world that might not otherwise be able to engage with his content.   Chikin Chow added that he\u2019s also excited to use the new editing tools to help save time. The rise of generative AI has animated the tech sector and broader public \u2014 becoming the latest buzzword out of Silicon Valley since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT service late last year. Some industry watchers and AI skeptics have argued that powerful new AI tools carry potential dangers, such as making it easier to spread misinformation via deepfake images, or perpetuate biases at a larger scale. Many creative professionals \u2014 whose works are often swept up into the datasets required to train and power AI tools \u2014 are also raising the alarm over potential intellectual property rights issues.  And some prominent figures inside and outside the tech industry even say there\u2019s a potential that AI can result in civilization \u201cextinction\u201d and compare its potential risk to that of \u201cnuclear war.\u201d  Despite the frenzy AI has caused, Chikin Chow told CNN that he ultimately views it as a \u201ccollaborator\u201d and a \u201csupplement\u201d to help propel his creative work forward.  \u201cI think that the people who are able to take change and move with it are the ones that are going to be successful long term,\u201d Chikin Chow said.

The agency, which is soliciting feedback from small businesses that may be affected, expects to issue a proposed rule next year, the bureau said Thursday.  If the rule is finalized, consumer credit companies would be barred from including medical debt and collection information on reports that creditors use to make underwriting decisions.  Creditors would only be able consider non-medical information when evaluating borrowers\u2019 loan applications. And debt collectors would no longer be able to use the listing of medical debt on credit reports as leverage to pressure consumers into paying questionable bills, the bureau said. \u201cResearch shows that medical bills have little predictive value in credit decisions, yet tens of millions of American households are dealing with medical debt on their credit reports,\u201d said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. \u201cWhen someone gets sick, they should be able to focus on getting better, rather than fighting debt collectors trying to extort them into paying bills they may not even owe.\u201d Roughly 20% of Americans reported having medical debt, according to a 2022 report from the bureau. But Chopra stressed that many health care bills contain mistakes. \u201cFamilies are often barraged with a string of confusing and error-ridden bills, and too many of us have ended up in a doom loop of disputes between insurance companies and health care providers,\u201d he said. \u201cThese bills, even ones where the patient doesn\u2019t owe anything further, can end up being reported on the patient\u2019s credit report.\u201d The proposals under consideration are the latest step in the bureau\u2019s efforts to curb the impact of medical debt on consumers. CFPB and other agencies are also looking into medical billing practices, including costly products such as medical credit cards and installment loans. The White House has also sought to help lessen Americans\u2019 medical debt burden as part of its effort to help people contend with inflation and higher costs of living. Last year, it laid out a four-point plan to help protect consumers, including having the bureau investigate credit reporting companies and debt collectors that violate patients\u2019 and families\u2019 rights. Medical debt has lowered people\u2019s credit scores, which affects their ability to buy a home, get a mortgage or own a small business, Vice President Kamala Harris said in a call with reporters on Thursday.  \u201cWe know credit scores determine whether a person can have economic health and well-being, much less the ability to grow their wealth,\u201d she said. \u201cToday, we are offering a solution to fix this problem \u2026 Together, these measures will improve the credit scores of millions of Americans so that they will better be able to invest in their future.\u201d Also last year, the three largest credit reporting agencies \u2013 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion \u2013 announced they would remove nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports. The agencies no longer include medical debt that went to collections on consumer credit reports once it has been paid off. That eliminated billions of dollars of debt on consumer records. In addition, unpaid medical collection debt no longer appears on credit reports for the first year, whereas the previous grace period was six months. That gives people more time to work with their health insurers or providers to address the bills. And medical collection debt of less than $500 is no longer included on credit reports.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T20:54:33Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230830113651-02-glenn-sulmasy.jpg?c=original", "title": "He was investigated for sexting a student at the Coast Guard Academy. He\u2019s now a college president.", "content": "A college president, who wants his campus to become the business school \u201cof choice for women,\u201d once exchanged hundreds of sexually suggestive messages with a student he taught at the prestigious Coast Guard Academy, prompting prosecutors to recommend charges against him in military court, according to confidential records obtained by CNN.  Attorneys at the Coast Guard were so troubled by Capt. Glenn Sulmasy\u2019s actions \u2014 and by the fact that he continued to work with students \u2014 that they recommended in early 2016 that he be charged with conduct unbecoming an officer even though he had retired from the service the prior year.   \u201cProsecution appears to be the only proper course of action,\u201d an attorney wrote in a February 2016 memo laying out the prosecution recommendation. Failing to act, the attorney added, could attract \u201csignificant negative publicity by the media, Congress and internal staff for the appearance of sweeping the case under the rug.\u201d  Coast Guard leaders, however, quashed the case and never prosecuted Sulmasy, which allowed his career in private academia to flourish. He now heads Nichols College, a small school in Massachusetts that focuses on business and leadership education.  Sulmasy\u2019s attorney, Jeffrey Robbins, defended his client, calling the prosecution memo, provided to him by CNN, \u201cridiculous on its face.\u201d He noted that \u201cthe intimate texts in question\u201d with the student were characterized by prosecutors as \u201cconsensual in nature\u201d and said that the proposed prosecution had been \u201crightfully rejected by the adults within the legal wing of the Coast Guard.\u201d   Following CNN inquiries, the chairman of the board of trustees at Nichols College said the school had launched an \u201cimpartial, third-party investigation into this matter\u201d and that they take \u201cthese allegations very seriously.\u201d In a note to the campus community last week, he said Sulmasy volunteered to take a leave of absence pending the results of that investigation.   The case from nearly a decade ago is another hidden example of the Coast Guard internally expressing concern about alleged misconduct but ultimately failing to hold its service members accountable.  CNN in June uncovered a secret investigation of rapes and sexual assaults at the agency\u2019s academy, which found that dozens of assaults had been mishandled, allowing some alleged sexual predators to ascend to high-level roles in the US military. The findings of that investigation, dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, had been withheld from Congress until CNN reporters started making inquiries. And, CNN found that the agency\u2019s top leaders had been behind the cover-up.  In the separate investigation into Sulmasy, Coast Guard investigators uncovered more than 1,600 texts between him and a young female student, the majority of which were of a \u201csexual or flirtatious nature,\u201d demonstrating that \u201cat best, he offered to give high grades and show favoritism in class in exchange for sexual banter, and at worst, he actually did so,\u201d according to the internal Coast Guard prosecution memo.   The memo said the student told investigators she had earned the grades herself and denied any sexual contact with Sulmasy. It also described the young woman as a \u201cwilling participant\u201d in the exchanges with Sulmasy and said she had been designated as a witness to his alleged misconduct and was not being granted the benefits given to victims of a crime.   The messages show Sulmasy, who also served as a department chair at the academy, commenting on how attracted he was to the student more than 20 years his junior, requesting photos of her and expressing his desire to \u201cspoil\u201d her. \u201cI am\u2026 a good boy \u2014 no final for the goddess,\u201d he wrote one night. \u201cJust know that I will give u a 100,\u201d he said about another assignment. \u201cDo u luv turning me on\u2026U really looked great and the nails were very hott.\u201d   Coast Guard attorneys found that the \u201cstrong\u201d evidence against him warranted prosecuting him in a military court-martial for conduct unbecoming an officer and willful dereliction of duty around eight months after he had retired from the academy and taken on an administrator role at a private university, records show.  While Sulmasy\u2019s misconduct case centered on his interactions with one female cadet, attorneys wrote that \u201cthere are likely other students whom [Capt.] Sulmasy pursued,\u201d saying that moving the case forward could possibly bring new women out of the shadows.   Attorneys noted in the prosecution memo that a court-martial of a retired officer was rare and said a successful prosecution for someone as well connected as Sulmasy was even more unlikely. But they argued that it was the \u201cCoast Guard\u2019s obligation to protect students and institutions.\u201d If successful, such a prosecution could have stripped Sulmasy of his pension and landed him behind bars, though prosecutors noted securing the maximum punishment for the alleged misconduct was unlikely.  In the end, Coast Guard leaders overruled the prosecutors and decided not to press charges against Sulmasy, keeping the findings of the investigation from being made public.  Sulmasy worked as provost at Bryant University for a number of years before leaving to become the president at Nichols College in Massachusetts in 2021. Bryant University did not respond to multiple requests for comment.   An academy graduate himself, Sulmasy worked at the academy for many years as an attorney, professor and eventually the head of the school\u2019s humanities department. During the Fouled Anchor investigation, Sulmasy was mentioned by at least one woman who said he discouraged her from pursuing a rape complaint against another cadet while he was working at the school in the late 1990s, court records show. Fouled Anchor investigators found a statement she had made about her alleged attack years later in a box labeled with Sulmasy\u2019s name.   A previous attorney for Sulmasy told CNN his client \u201chas no recollection of any such conversation from a quarter of a century ago, much less of having said anything that would discourage any cadet from putting another cadet on report for a serious criminal offense.\u201d His current attorney disputed that Sulmasy had ever been in a meeting with the woman, noting she told investigators she initially met with Sulmasy at a time before he had begun working at the academy. The attorney for Sulmasy pointed CNN to a 2016 ruling by a military judge who stated that the cadet reported her rape allegation to four Coast Guard Academy authorities, none of whom were Sulmasy. That ruling described Sulmasy\u2019s boss as a \u201cprimary\u201d individual with whom the woman spoke about her allegation in the 1990s.   In a 2017 court filing, however, military attorneys described Sulmasy as a \u201cmain witness\u201d with whom the cadet talked about her rape allegation. In an interview with CNN, the woman said she specifically remembered meeting with Sulmasy about her allegation.   In the wake of CNN\u2019s reporting on Fouled Anchor, the Coast Guard launched a review of its policies on assault and harassment and announced changes in how allegations are handled by the agency. And former vice commandant Charles Ray, who declined comment, resigned from his position at a Coast Guard Academy leadership institute after CNN reported he helped keep Fouled Anchor secret. Both House and Senate lawmakers have slammed the agency for keeping the investigation secret and called for independent investigations, with a Senate inquiry announced just last week. And House lawmakers have introduced legislation that would increase protections for academy cadets reporting sexual assault allegations.   CNN started asking questions and filed a public records request about the Coast Guard\u2019s investigation into Sulmasy more than three months ago, but the agency has yet to provide any details of the investigation or explain why charges were not filed as recommended, saying last week that \u201clegal constraints prevent the Coast Guard from commenting on personnel matters related to Mr. Sulmasy.\u201d   Melissa McCafferty, a 2011 academy graduate, says it wasn\u2019t long after arriving on campus that she began hearing a whisper network of warnings from upperclassmen about Sulmasy.   According to McCafferty, Sulmasy verbally harassed her, telling her she looked good in her pencil skirt and making sexual comments. As the harassment continued, she says she told a female professor at the academy, who was herself a Coast Guard sexual assault survivor, what had happened, but the woman warned that she should stay silent, saying Sulmasy was \u201cuntouchable\u201d and that saying something could \u201cjeopardize (her) career.\u201d   After she graduated from the academy, McCafferty said she reached out to Sulmasy to see if he would write her a letter of recommendation for law school based on her academic performance at the academy. But in response, she remembers him texting back that he would only write her a letter if she sent him pictures of herself, telling her he had always loved her foot tattoo. \u201cI stopped the conversation and found a letter elsewhere\u2026 It made me feel very dirty and disrespected and very dehumanized,\u201d she said.   She said she saved the messages for years but was never asked about them so discarded the phone when she retired in 2019. She did, however, connect CNN to a former colleague who confirmed having viewed the text messages and that they came from a captain in the Coast Guard. The colleague, however, didn\u2019t remember the captain\u2019s name.   Sulmasy\u2019s attorney told CNN that McCafferty\u2019s allegations were \u201ccategorically false.\u201d  The Coast Guard told CNN that it had referred allegations from McCafferty to Coast Guard criminal investigators after being contacted by CNN and urged \u201canyone who has experienced or observed assault or harassment within the Coast Guard to make reports to their command or to the Coast Guard Investigative Service.\u201d McCafferty confirmed to CNN that she had been contacted by Coast Guard investigators about her allegations.  Today, McCafferty, a recent Georgetown Law graduate, says she is still angry about the way she and other female students were treated and says it is unacceptable that the Coast Guard had an opportunity to hold Sulmasy accountable for his actions but didn\u2019t.  \u201cA lot of these people were his friends. They went to school with him,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just wanted it to go away.\u201d  Do you have information or an experience to share related to the Coast Guard Academy or the Coast Guard at large?

The duo\u2019s friends included Grace\u2019s assistant Karen Walker (Megan Mullally), an alcoholic socialite whose husband was in jail, and actor Jack McFarland, played by Sean Hayes. Its depiction of single, urbanites \u2013 some gay, some straight \u2013 was considered groundbreaking at the time.   \u201cI was conflicted at that time,\u201d Hayes, who is gay and whose character was gay, told Jake Tapper in 2017. \u201cI don\u2019t have the DNA to be a spokesperson of any group of people.

McCormack said that despite some restrictions on scripts\u2019 subject matter, the show began to \u201ceducate people a little bit\u201d by making jokes that got past network censors who didn\u2019t even know what they meant.  \u201cI loved that,\u201d he said at the Paley event. Kohan said that anytime they found they had avoided a topic, they then wrote it into the show.  \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we seeing Will kissing his boyfriend? Let\u2019s write it in, that became a story,\u201d he said at the Paley event. That Season 2 episode, titled \u201cActing Out,\u201d showed Will kiss Jack in front of Al Roker in the \u201cToday\u201d show audience. There were many more trailblazing episodes, including Will\u2019s coming out episode in the third season of its original run. The show contained a flashback to when Will came out to Grace when the two were dating in college. \u201cI remember that as being a powerful episode both on the page and on the stage,\u201d Mutchnick told The Hollywood Reporter.  Soon, the show was so impactful, A-listers began guest starring, including Sharon Stone, Edie Falco, Britney Spears, Madonna and, famously, Cher.  Hayes recalled his iconic scene with Cher in the Season 3 episode \u201cGypsies, Tramps and Weed,\u201d where Jack thought Cher was a drag queen and told her his Cher impersonation was better. \u201cIt was so wild to have the character be in love with this icon and superstar like Cher, and then have Cher on the show, like, out of nowhere,\u201d Hayes told People.  The Cher cameo was a milestone for a show that had an uncertain fate from the beginning.  \u201cAt first we thought we would be canceled, but by the third season we realized that the show was beloved, that the characters were beloved, and we were representing a community that had never been represented on primetime television before, and it felt important and exciting,\u201d Messing told Access Hollywood.

Matt Gaetz of Florida posted a picture of McCarthy in a Ukraine pin and with a yellow and blue pocket square, writing, \u201cHow does this make you feel?\u201d GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia posted a scene of Lord Farquaad calling his troops to battle from the animated film \u201cShrek,\u201d tweeting, \u201cWashington warlords speaking to the American people about Ukraine.\u201d  President Joe Biden welcomed Zelensky to the White House on Thursday afternoon after the Ukrainian president also toured the Pentagon. Biden is seeking to hear a \u201cbattlefield perspective\u201d from Zelensky as a second autumn of war approaches, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told reporters. Biden is expected to talk to Zelensky about battlefield needs, Kirby said, but it comes amid CNN reporting that ATACMS, the long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems, may not be part of a new weapons package, something Zelensky suggested to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer would be a disappointment. ATACMS are \u201cnot off the table,\u201d Kirby said. Zelensky arrives amid shutdown fight Zelensky\u2019s visit came as House Republicans are engaged in a bitter fight over government funding on the domestic front and as the prospects for more money for Ukraine \u2013 while very much alive in the Senate \u2013 are far less clear in the House even as the Biden administration as sent over a request for $24 billion in support.  \u201cThe first thing I will tell you is there is no money in the House right now for Ukraine,\u201d Rep. Byron Donalds, a conservative member of the House Freedom Caucus from Florida, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good time for him to be here, quite frankly. That\u2019s just the reality.\u201d Texas Rep. Chip Roy, another conservative, told CNN, \u201cWhen was the last time Zelensky came here? Right before money. You think that is a coincidence? I don\u2019t. That is why this Ukraine game needs to stop.\u201d  Zelensky met Thursday with leaders in the US House of Representatives including McCarthy, but the speaker has said that no one-on-one meeting is planned nor will Zelensky have a chance to meet with the GOP conference where he could speak directly to the members opposed to funding his war effort.   A source told CNN that McCarthy denied Zelensky a joint session of Congress, which would have allowed him to give a speech and address everyone, a point first reported by Punchbowl. McCarthy told reporters: \u201cWhat I was asked for was a joint session. We don\u2019t have time for a joint session.\u201d  \u201cSo, I did exactly what I\u2019ve done with the prime minister of Italy, the prime minister of the UK, I always bring when leaders come in, I bring a bipartisan group of leadership together,\u201d he added.  McCarthy also denied official photographers access to the room where House leaders met Zelensky, the source added. But, a source shared photos from the room. \u201cI do think the more people who could hear from him directly, the more impact that it would have,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, told CNN.  Kirby said there is a \u201ccritical need\u201d for Congress to grant the White House\u2019s $24 billion supplemental funding request for Ukraine for its counteroffensive capabilities, saying that the aid \u201cwill have a significant impact on Ukraine\u2019s fight.\u201d In contrast, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are holding a joint meeting with their members in the Senate.  Despite a slip in public support, there is still strong bipartisan backing for Ukraine funding on Capitol Hill, but it will be up to McCarthy to decide if legislation will even be put on the floor. The speaker has said he doesn\u2019t want funding attached to a short-term spending bill and he\u2019s also said it should be a standalone issue. But time is of the essence, with aides close to the matter telling CNN the expectation is that current US funding accounts for Ukraine could be depleted as soon as by the end of the year. \u201cThis becomes an issue that time and time again, minute to minute, every question is: Is Speaker McCarthy going to do the responsible thing of putting the bill on the floor that we know will pass with broad bipartisan support?\u201d Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia said. \u201cIf he lives in this constant fear that one member on his far right is going to take the action of motion to vacate the chair, therefore removing him from the speakership, then we are making day-to-day decisions or not making day-to-day decisions because one guy wants to keep his job. \u201c Shifting public support makes Ukraine funding risky Inside McCarthy\u2019s conference, the question of helping Ukraine is being framed by isolationists as a choice between helping Americans or helping Ukraine. \u201cI think every single person in this Congress, Democrat, Republican or in between is appalled, shocked and disagrees with what Russia and Vladimir Putin has done and is doing. That having been said, our borders are wide open. Our people cannot afford their electric bills, their gas bills and their food bills and before we send blank checks to some other country, we need to take care of our own people,\u201d said Rep. Scott Perry, a conservative Republican from Pennsylvania.  A CNN poll in August found now a majority of Americans are opposed to authorizing more funding for Ukraine, and among Republicans, the number opposed soars to 71%. It\u2019s a reality reflected in how Republican members \u2013 even those who don\u2019t rule out more funding \u2013 talk about US support for Ukraine.  \u201cDo you know who is winning the war in Ukraine right now? I don\u2019t think the average member of Congress understands what is going on in Ukraine,\u201d said Rep. Mike Garcia, a Republican from California. \u201cI don\u2019t think the executive branch knows what is going on in Ukraine right now. Look, we\u2019ve invested $100 billion of American taxpayer dollars in Ukraine, we owe it to the American taxpayers to get an accountability of that money, the accountability of the weapons, to get a current status of what\u2019s going on in Ukraine \u2026 and what is needed to win and how we are going to be involved in it before we invest.\u201d  Rep. Garret Graves, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed the administration for a slide in support even as he argued it was still essential.  \u201cThe fiscally responsible thing to do here is to stop this in Ukraine. This crosses over into NATO countries and you trigger article five, you aren\u2019t going to be talking bout tens of billions of dollars, you are going to be talking about trillions of dollars and you are going to be talking about American service men and women on the front lines. That is not an option,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThis administration has both accountability and transparency issues they\u2019ve got to address before they deserve another penny.\u201d One of the most difficult balances Zelensky will face on Capitol Hill on Thursday is acknowledging why he needs the US aid, why it hasn\u2019t been enough so far and how long he thinks he will actually be relying on the support as public fatigue over the war effort looms.  There is still a strong coalition of GOP support for Ukraine funding on Capitol Hill, such as McConnell, but Republicans have at times been critical of how the president has engaged in the war and how he has sold the US aid. Those GOP lawmakers argue Biden could do more to both sell the importance of the war effort to the public and to ensure members of Congress are kept in the loop on where and what impact the funding they are appropriating is having.  \u201cThe consequences of pulling the plug on Ukraine are enormous,\u201d said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \u201cIt will lead to more war, not less. It will destroy a world order that has existed that has benefited the world. So I could not disagree more with my colleagues who say Ukraine doesn\u2019t matter to us. It matters a lot.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T09:00:13Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921151040-01-kevin-mccarthy-092123.jpg?c=original", "title": "How unusual is it for the House to fail to pass a rule? A look at the recent history", "content": "Since 1995, the House has failed to pass a rule eight times, all during Republican-led House chambers \u2013 until this year.  Newt Gingrich had six rule votes fail during his four-year tenure as speaker (1995-1999), and Dennis Hastert suffered two rule defeats in his eight years as speaker. (1999-2007) So far, in his eight months as speaker, Kevin McCarthy has lost three rule votes, bringing the total up to 11 since 1995. Speakers John Boehner, Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan never lost a rule vote during their tenures. The House has two ways to pass legislation: By coming directly to the floor for an up-or-down vote, or making a quick pit-stop at the House Rules Committee.  What\u2019s the difference?  Bills that come directly to the House floor for a vote and bypass the Rules Committee are passed \u201cunder suspension of the Rule\u201d and require a two-thirds majority of the voting members to pass. Bills that make the pit-stop in the Rules Committee come to the floor with certain debate parameters that must be fulfilled, but this method enables those bills to pass the chamber with a simple majority. But those debate parameters, called \u201cthe rule,\u201d must also first be debated and voted on before the House can debate and vote on the underlying bill.  So if it adds more time and more votes, why do it? Simple answer \u2013 it\u2019s easier to pass some legislation with 218 votes than 291, especially when your majority is small. The House Rules Committee \u2013 also referred to as the \u201cspeaker\u2019s committee\u201d \u2013 is highly allied with the House speaker and the committee membership skews heavily in the majority party\u2019s favor. So legislation that comes through Rules is typically exactly what the majority leadership wants it to say.  How does it work? After the Rules Committee debates and passes the rule, the bill then comes to the House floor, where the two sides debate the rule, then vote on its passage. When the rule passes, then debate on the actual bill begins. So rule failures are rare, because all that vote really does is allow the House to actually begin debating whatever bill is to follow. Voting down a rule essentially is a vote to not even discuss the bill. And since the minority party rarely, if ever, votes for a rule (see above that it\u2019s heavily skewed to the majority) the votes to kill a rule must come from within the majority party itself.  So, voting down the rule is basically voting against your own leadership? Yup.

But Black employees say they experienced \u2018toxicity and racism\u2019", "content": "Nnete Matima said she was attracted to work at TikTok because of how the social media platform was \u201creally built upon Black culture\u201d and the work of Black creators. She saw and welcomed TikTok\u2019s public pledge of support for the Black community in the wake of the 2020 police murder of George Floyd and applied to work for the company because she felt its corporate values \u201creally resonated with me,\u201d Matima told CNN. Shortly after she began working at TikTok-parent company ByteDance last year, however, she alleges she encountered \u201ctoxicity and racism\u201d in the workplace. Her manager would refer to her as a \u201cblack snake\u201d behind her back and set unrealistic and uneven expectations for her compared to her white peers, Matima claims. The mistreatment only got worse, she said, after she spoke up about it via human resources channels.   Matima is one of two Black former ByteDance employees who together filed a formal complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Thursday. Their complaint asks the agency to investigate alleged racial discrimination and retaliation against Black workers at the social media giant.  Corporate America has long come under fire for racism in the workplace, especially in the wake of the racial reckoning that swept through the nation in 2020. The criticism is especially pointed for technology companies, where having employees with diverse perspectives is especially crucial because tech products have faced accusations of perpetuating racial and ethnic discrimination. Matima, who is based in New York City, and fellow former employee Jo\u00ebl Carter, who is based in Austin, Texas, alleged in the proposed class action complaint that they each faced repeated instances of discrimination at work and then faced retaliation when they raised concerns about it. \u201cRather than holding anyone accountable, TikTok denied the blatant discrimination that Ms. Matima and Mr. Carter suffered, failed to stop it from continuing, engaged in sham \u2018investigations\u2019 of their complaints, took away their work, and then terminated Ms. Matima and Mr. Carter in retaliation for complaining about race discrimination and mistreatment,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cWe are asking the EEOC to investigate TikTok\u2019s pattern or practice of retaliation against workers who complain about discrimination,\u201d the complaint adds. In a statement to CNN on Thursday, a TikTok spokesperson said: \u201cWe take employee concerns very seriously, and have strong policies in place that prohibit discrimination, harassment, and retaliation in the workplace. As an organization, we have a strong record of championing diversity and inclusion.\u201d TikTok skyrocketed in popularity in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic and as of this year has amassed more than 150 million American users. As the app has become more entrenched in American culture, it has also faced mounting scrutiny from US lawmakers over perceived security concerns due to its China-based parent company\u2019s ties to Beijing. Talks of an outright US ban of the app have simmered in Washington, DC, since the Trump era but have largely subsided in recent months as lawmakers turn their attention to the rise of generative AI out of Silicon Valley.  Even TikTok itself has also acknowledged the important role that Black users play on the platform \u2014 and its need to support them.  \u201cBlack creators inspire mainstream culture and continue to define what\u2019s next \u2014 from creating viral moments and pioneering new spaces in fashion and music, to advocating for others and organizing for a better future, they have always been at the forefront of innovation,\u201d the company said in a statement last January.  Two years earlier, TikTok had acknowledged concerns that Black users felt \u201cunsafe, unsupported, or suppressed\u201d and vowed to \u201cactively promote and protect\u201d diversity on the platform.  \u2018Dehumanizing and demoralizing\u2019 Carter, who began working at TikTok in June 2021, told CNN in an interview that experience at the company was \u201cdehumanizing\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d Carter was initially hired as a risk analyst responsible for managing the safety of TikTok\u2019s ad ecosystem, but was transferred to the platform\u2019s ad policy team as a policy manager eight months later. Shortly after starting his new role, Carter alleges, he discovered that he was being significantly underpaid compared to his colleagues. He says he raised these concerns to human resources and his department leader. Carter was at the time the only Black employee on his 80-person ad policy team, the complaint states. Carter\u2019s manager prevented him from attending important meetings and took credit for Carter\u2019s work, according to the complaint. Carter alleges that in response to his complaints, his role at the company \u201cwas changed and severely diminished,\u201d prompting him to again alert human resources that he was concerned about discrimination and retaliation. The complaint filed with the EEOC shares parts of Carter\u2019s April 2022 performance evaluation, where he was given an overall score of: \u201cExceeds expectations.\u201d A reviewer described Carter as \u201copen and humble above all\u201d and a \u201cgreat teammate.\u201d He was \u201chappy to provide assistance or guidance whenever needed. He never had an ego and was always open to collaboration and feedback,\u201d the reviewer added, per the complaint. But after Carter began raising concerns at work about racial discrimination, he alleges he was retaliated against in a performance review in April 2023. He was labeled as \u201ctense\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d and accused of \u201cslamming doors\u201d in the office in that review, the complaint states. But Carter says he never slammed a door in the office. In fact, he says, the doors at the office were hydraulic \u2014 not even capable of being slammed. Carter told CNN that he felt his managers were trying \u201cto establish this narrative of me about being the \u2018angry Black man.\u2019\u201d Carter grew emotional as he talked to CNN about the pain and \u201cthe historic significance of using that kind of inflammatory language, especially when it\u2019s unfounded.\u201d His experience at work deeply impacted his mental health, and for the first time in his life he began seeing a psychiatrist and dealing with symptoms of depression for \u201cmonths on end,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like overwhelming feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.\u201d Matima \u2014 who worked in sales for Lark, ByteDance\u2019s workplace communication division \u2014 similarly alleges she was treated differently from the colleagues on her team \u201cwho were nearly all white,\u201d according to the complaint. For example, Matima says she was not given adequate time to complete required onboarding courses before being asked to start her work, so she had to finish the courses during nights and weekends. By contrast, Matima\u2019s white colleagues \u201cwere given ample time during normal work hours to complete their training before they were required to start their sales outreach,\u201d the complaint states. In January 2023, the complaint alleges, Matima was told by a colleague that her manager and other colleagues \u201ccommonly referred\u201d to her as a \u201cblack snake.\u201d \u201cThis outrageous \u2018black snake\u2019 nickname was not only racially derogatory and inflammatory, but also suggested that Ms. Matima is a deceitful, untrustworthy, and sneaky person,\u201d the complaint states. Matima and Carter both allege that multiple requests to switch managers were denied and that their complaints to the company\u2019s human resources department were not adequately investigated and managed.  Both Matima and Carter were ultimately terminated by TikTok in August. Now Matima says she feels a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to share the experiences publicly. \u201cWhen there is injustice happening, it festers in the dark and the shadows,\u201d she said. \u201cBy going public, we can inspire others who are still suffering in there to stand up and speak out.\u201d Are you a current for former employee of TikTok or ByteDance and have information to share about what it\u2019s like to work there?

Former Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, who is also seeking the GOP presidential nomination, drew on Trump\u2019s comments as part of his argument that his former running mate is moving away from conservative principles. \u201cJust this weekend again, you saw [Trump] walking away from our commitment to the sanctity of human life. I\u2019m pro-life. People that know me know, I\u2019ll always stand for the unborn. He actually said that a Heartbeat Bill adopted in Florida, and in places like Georgia and Ohio and South Carolina, and Iowa was a quote, terrible mistake,\u201d he said of Trump on Fox Business. He also told Fox News Radio that Trump\u2019s comments \u201cjust suggests to me that he is backing away from that cause.\u201d  Pence, who has challenged the GOP field to commit to a 15-week federal ban and is clear about his opposition to abortion, was far from being the only of Trump\u2019s competitors to call out the former president for his comments. The Republican presidential field has been split on the issue of abortion, which particularly has galvanized voters since the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade last year in prior elections. Trump, for his part, has vacillated on his approach to the polarizing issue. He has said both privately and publicly that he does not believe abortion is a winning political issue, particularly in a general election. During campaign speeches he has often avoided the topic altogether. However, he has repeatedly sought to take credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade after appointing three conservative justices to the Supreme Court while serving as president.  Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said Thursday that Trump is \u201cwrong on the issue\u201d in not backing a 15-week federal ban, and suggested that he would sponsor Senate legislation next week banning abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy. \u201cBut he\u2019s not alone. Ron (DeSantis) has the same position. Nikki (Haley) has the same position and Vivek (Ramaswamy) has the same position of letting the states decide on when they stop abortions,\u201d he said on Fox News Radio. Campaigning in Iowa this week, where the abortion issue is important to the state\u2019s Christian conservative voters, Scott, who has been reluctant to attack other Republicans, called out Trump over his comments and refusing to specify how many weeks of pregnancy he\u2019d support restricting abortion. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has also leaned on the issue lately to draw a distinction between him and Trump. On Monday, DeSantis said on a local Iowa radio station that \u201call pro-lifers should know that he\u2019s preparing to sell you out.\u201d In an interview with ABC News this week, DeSantis, who was the target of Trump\u2019s NBC comments, said Trump made a \u201cbig mistake\u201d for saying some Republicans pursued \u201cterrible\u201d state-level restrictions on abortion. The Florida governor had signed a bill into law in April that\u2019s not in effect yet but would ban most abortions after six weeks. Trump \u201cclaimed to be pro-life. He spoke at the March for Life and was waxing eloquently about how everybody counts. For him to then attack people like Iowa, South Carolina, Florida, all these other states, I thought was a big mistake,\u201d DeSantis told ABC News. \u201cWhen you provide pro-life protections that says when a baby has a heartbeat, that there\u2019s protections, that is not something that pro-lifers think is terrible. They think that that is a noble and just thing to do,\u201d DeSantis said. Asked if he thought Trump was \u201cpro-life,\u201d DeSantis said, \u201cWell, you tell me.\u201d \u201cIf you have something where you have a baby that has a detectable heartbeat, if you\u2019re pro-life, you would want to say that there should be protections there. And he\u2019s saying that that\u2019s a terrible thing. I know most pro-life voters would, would think that he\u2019s wrong,\u201d the Florida governor said. He, like Pence, also argued Trump is a \u201cdifferent candidate\u201d than who he was in 2015 and has drifted on positions favorable with Republican voters. \u201cHe\u2019s taking positions that I think are different from what he took in 2015 when he first came onto the scene, and I do think he\u2019s a different candidate today than he was back then,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI think the one back then was probably closer to where Republican voters want to be than the latest iteration.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments have also raised alarm among Iowa Republicans and Christian conservatives in the state \u2013 a key voting bloc that has helped propel candidates in the race. Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, who has left the door open to a late endorsement in the 2024 primary, also appeared to take issue with the president\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s never a \u2018terrible thing\u2019 to protect innocent life,\u201d the Republican governor wrote on X Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the fetal heartbeat bill the Iowa legislature passed and I signed in 2018 and again earlier this year.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump said during a campaign stop in Iowa that Republicans \u201cmust learn how to properly talk about abortion\u201d if they want to win in 2024. \u201cWe\u2019d probably lose the majorities in 2024 without the exceptions,\u201d Trump told a crowd of more than 1,000 at his campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa, referring to exceptions of rape, incest and health of the mother, which he supports.  \u201cYou have to follow your heart. You can\u2019t just do it for elections\u2026 but at the same time you have to win elections,\u201d he said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T19:36:04Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210412154235-lachlan-murdoch-file.jpg?c=original", "title": "Who is Lachlan Murdoch, the new chairman of Fox and News Corp?", "content": "Lachlan Murdoch, the eldest son of Rupert Murdoch, has  been anointed to take over his father\u2019s vast media empire, capping years of rampant media speculation and thinly veiled fraternal feuding.  The decision, announced Thursday, makes 52-year-old Lachlan the sole chairman of Fox News\u2019 parent company, Fox Corporation, and News Corporation, owner of the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and other newspapers.   Although his closest siblings, Elisabeth and James, had previously been seen as contenders for the throne, Lachlan\u2019s ascension became all but guaranteed over the past few years. In lock step with his dad, Lachlan has co-chaired both Fox and News corporations, and was named CEO of Fox News in 2019.  Ninety-two-year-old Rupert Murdoch, one of the most influential media tycoons of the modern era, will continue to serve on the boards as chairman emeritus. \u201cWe thank him for his vision, his pioneering spirit, his steadfast determination, and the enduring legacy he leaves to the companies he founded and countless people he has impacted,\u201d Lachlan said in a statement Thursday. The Murdochs\u2019 seemingly boundless wealth \u2014 Forbes estimates the family is worth nearly $18 billion \u2014 and their at times messy behind-the-scenes feuding has long made them a source of intrigue in elite media and business circles. Writers for the HBO series \u201cSuccession\u201d drew heavily on the Murdochs\u2019 lives in their creation of the fictional Roy family. (HBO and CNN are owned by the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.)\u00a0 Succession drama Rupert Murdoch grew his business from relatively modest roots, inheriting an Australian newspaper business from his father in 1952. Over the next seven decades, Murdoch pushed aggressively into British and American markets, buying up newspapers, launching the Fox network, acquiring the 20th Century Fox film studio and upending the cable news scene with the debut of Fox News in 1996. With his second wife, Rupert welcomed three children: Elisabeth, Lachlan and James.  The two brothers, just 15 months apart in age, were deeply competitive as kids, and over the years they traded the roles of \u201cheir apparent and jilted son,\u201d according to a 2019 New York Times Magazine article on the family.  \u201cIt was no secret to those close to the family that Murdoch had always favored Lachlan,\u201d according to the magazine. Succession planning for his media behemoth appeared to begin in earnest in 2015, when Rupert named Lachlan and James as co-chairmen of 21st Century Fox.  But in 2020, James, who backed Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign and has donated to Democratic-leaning causes, dramatically broke with the company, citing \u201cdisagreements over certain editorial content,\u201d among other reasons.   Elisabeth, who has been in and out of the family business while building her own career as a television producer, often felt she was being overshadowed by her brothers, according to a 2012 profile of her in the New Yorker. A family friend who was quoted in the profile compared Elisabeth to Cordelia, the devoted daughter in Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear.  \u201cShe loves her father,\u201d the friend told the magazine, \u201cbut she\u2019s the wrong sex.\u201d Lachlan\u2019s takeover Lachlan has been at the helm of Fox News since 2019, overseeing an era of rampant misinformation about the 2020 election and the Covid-19 pandemic. Although he has privately criticized Trump, people familiar with the matter told CNN last year, Rupert signaled to employees Thursday that Lachlan will maintain the network\u2019s right-wing editorial bent. \u201cMy father firmly believed in freedom, and Lachlan is absolutely committed to the cause,\u201d Rupert said in a memo to staff.  Lachlan ultimately approved Fox\u2019s extraordinary decision not to air the first live hearings conducted by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. The network opted instead to run commentary on the hearing from right-wing presenters Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.

Abraham Teklu Lemma, 50, from Maryland, faces three charges, including gathering or delivering defense information to aid a foreign government and unauthorized possession of national defense information and willfully retaining it. His arrest last month was kept under seal until Thursday.   Lemma is a naturalized US citizen from Ethiopia, according to court documents. He has worked at various US government agencies since 2019 \u2013 including as a help desk technician at the State Department and as an analyst for the Justice Department.   The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general, and the State Department\u2019s security service are investigating the matter. A lawyer for Lemma is not yet publicly listed. His government work, prosecutors say, gave him a security clearance access to highly classified information, which he illegally copied and shared with a foreign agent.   Since last summer, Lemma repeatedly used that access to search for classified intelligence reports related to an unnamed African country where Lemma previously had citizenship. Though court documents only refer to the country as the \u201cRelevant Country,\u201d CNN has confirmed the country is Ethiopia.  Between December 2022 and August 2023, Lemma \u201ccopied and pasted information from at least 85 Intelligence Reports regarding many topics\u2014the majority of which relate to the Relevant Country,\u201d court documents allege. He also allegedly accessed at least 48 additional intelligence reports and printed and downloaded highly classified information from those reports.  On at least three occasions, court documents say, Lemma copied intelligence reports onto CDs and DVDs, downloaded multiple items classified as top secret or secret and deleted the classified markings on those documents.  He also sent classified information to an agent from the intelligence service in Ethiopia, including satellite imagery and documents over an encrypted messaging app, court documents say.   The agent allegedly told Lemma what information to look for, and the two discussed \u201cmilitary activities of a rebel group involved in an armed struggle against\u201d the Ethiopian government.  Messages cited by investigators in court documents suggest that, during a visit to Ethiopia earlier this year, Lemma and the agent agreed to meet at a hotel in the country\u2019s capital. Several times during his trip to the country, Lemma allegedly accessed and made physical copies of classified US material through the State Department.  Bank records obtained by investigators show that Lemma, after downloading classified information and after his visits to the country, deposited money in several batches to different banks.   State Dept. initiates internal security review The State Department made the discovery that a contractor was sending classified information to Ethiopia as part of a \u201cself-initiated 60-day Internal Security Review of the Department of State\u2019s Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) network, systems, and applications,\u201d State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Thursday.  The Bureau of Intelligence and Research review was initiated following the arrest of Jack Teixeira, Miller said. \u201cDuring this review, information was uncovered indicating that a Department of State information technology contractor may have removed, retained and transmitted classified national defense information without authorization,\u201d Miller said.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T19:12:23Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230921155752-polish-krab-ukraine-011723.jpg?c=original", "title": "Poland and Ukraine are feuding over weapons and grain. How did we get here, and what does it mean for the war?", "content": "It appeared to be a reversal that threatened major implications for the war. On Wednesday, the prime minister of Poland, one of Kyiv\u2019s closest and most vocal allies, said it would \u201cno longer transfer weapons to Ukraine.\u201d Yet this apparently bullish move, announced amid a bitter spat with Ukraine over grain, has now evolved into a much murkier situation.  Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday moved to walk back his prime minister\u2019s comments, saying they were \u201cinterpreted in the worst possible way.\u201d Both Duda and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have attempted to thaw the angry spat. But animosity remains after months of tensions over a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports to a number of European Union countries. It also follows a pattern of increasingly confrontational behavior towards Kyiv from Poland\u2019s government, just weeks before a tight general election. Here\u2019s what you need to know. What has Poland announced? \u201cWe no longer transfer weapons to Ukraine because we are now arming Poland,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a blunt social media statement on Wednesday that accelerated the confrontation between the allies. Morawiecki added in a television interview that Poland would now focus on supplying \u201cthe most modern weapons\u201d for its own purposes, state news agency PAP reported. \u201cIf you want to defend yourself you have to have something to defend with,\u201d the prime minister said. The government meanwhile clarified he was referring to future weapons shipments, and those already agreed upon would still be completed. Nonetheless, it seemed to indicate a major change in policy: Poland has been one of the most forthright countries in the race to get weapons and resources into Ukrainian hands. Now, Warsaw was apparently drawing a line in the sand on future donations \u2013 a potential blow for Kyiv in the event of a long, drawn-out war.  But on Thursday, Duda sought to clarify Morawiecki\u2019s statement, saying it merely referred to new weapons being purchased for the Polish army, and that older weapons systems Warsaw deems not necessary for modernizing its own military could still be shipped across the border. \u201cThe prime minister talked about these weapons in the context of the new weapons we are buying for our army,\u201d Duda told Polish channel TVN24. \u201cThat was the statement. In my opinion, the prime minister said: \u2018We will not transfer to Ukraine new weapons that we are currently purchasing as part of the modernization of our army.\u2019 Duda added, \u201cplease remember that we have contracts signed with Ukraine, for example for the supply of Krabs (howitzers).\u201d Poland still needs to fulfill that agreement, as well as other contracts, including for ammunition and mine-clearing vehicles, which \u201care needed for the counteroffensive,\u201d Duda said.  \u201cAs we receive new weapons from (South) Korea and the United States, we will loosen the weapons we have in stock today. Perhaps we will transfer weapons that will be removed from the Polish army to Ukraine, just as we have done so far when we transferred post-Soviet weapons,\u201d Duda said.  There has meanwhile never been any suggestion that Poland \u2013 the key conduit country for almost all weapons transfers into Ukraine \u2013 would stop allowing other Western weapons to pass through its borders on the way to the frontlines.  And both countries have quickly moved to dissipate anger. Kyiv\u2019s minister of agrarian policy said he had spoken with his Polish counterpart and issued a statement saying the pair \u201cdiscussed the situation and Ukraine\u2019s proposal to resolve it, and agreed to find a solution that takes into account the interests of both countries.\u201d But Duda\u2019s comments left it unclear what the true effect of Warsaw\u2019s pronouncements might be, or whether any weapons intended for Ukraine would be impacted.   How did we get here? Pressure has been building for months over a ban on Ukrainian grain, initially put in place earlier this year by several EU nations to protect the livelihood of local farmers worried about being undercut by the low price of Ukrainian grain. Last week, the EU announced plans to suspend the rule. But three nations \u2013 Poland, Hungary and Slovakia \u2013 said they intended to defy the change and keep the restrictions in place. It prompted protests from Ukraine, which this week filed lawsuits against all three countries over the issue. Ukraine, often called the \u201cbreadbasket of Europe\u201d due to the vast quantities of grain it produces, had its Black Sea ports blockaded by Russia following its full-scale invasion in February 2022.  Fearing that the situation was \u201cthreatening global food security,\u201d the European Commission set up what it called \u201csolidarity lanes\u201d in May to facilitate exports, and temporarily eliminated all duties and quotas on Ukraine\u2019s exports, allowing a glut of cheap Ukrainian grain to flow into the continent.  Anger in Poland has been simmering since the spring, when farmers led demonstrations against the moves. But they erupted once again in recent days, after the decision of the three nations to ignore the removal of the ban.  In a swipe against the trio on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the UN General Assembly in New York that \u201cit is alarming to see how some in Europe, some of our friends in Europe, play out solidarity in a political theater \u2013 making a thriller from the grain.\u201d  Zelensky added that the nations involved \u201cmay seem to play their own role but in fact they are helping set the stage to a Moscow actor.\u201d His comments sparked immediate condemnation from Poland, with the foreign ministry summoning the Ukrainian ambassador to convey its \u201cstrong protest.\u201d Those comments intensified anger in Warsaw, resulting just hours later in Morawiecki\u2019s statement on weapons shipments. When asked whether he was upset after Zelensky\u2019s words, Duda told TVN24 \u201cmaybe upset is a too strong word.\u201d \u201cI was embittered, I would rather put it that way. I say this: let\u2019s stay calm, please do not raise the temperature, because this is a dispute that concerns a small part of our relations. Let\u2019s not allow it to affect the whole, because there is no justification for it and only others will benefit from it,\u201d Duda said.  A tight election looms Poland\u2019s initial response to the war on Ukraine earned its populist government a rare swelling of goodwill from across Europe, and made it a major player in the Western response to Russia\u2019s aggression. The country has taken in more than 1.5 million Ukrainian refugees and allowed 15 million to cross its borders to flee the conflict. The two countries shared a decades-old suspicion of Moscow and Warsaw had warned for years of the pitfalls of buying Russian energy, which melded their relationship in the initial phases of the war. But tensions have frayed in recent months, exacerbated by a pivotal election. Poland\u2019s populist ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), are preparing for a vote on October 15 which opinion polls suggest could result in them losing their parliamentary majority. They are particularly suffering in their stronghold rural regions in eastern Poland, where agriculture is an important economic pillar. PiS is losing a chunk of its typical voter base to the Confederation party, a historically far-right group that has been rallying against the costs of Warsaw\u2019s military aid to Kyiv and complained that Ukraine\u2019s plight has become a greater priority for the government than that of Polish people. In response, PiS has seemingly toned down its support for Kyiv in recent months and shown willingness to take on a more combative stance. In August, Warsaw summoned the Ukrainian ambassador to Poland after a Polish foreign policy adviser accused Kyiv of being ungrateful for Poland\u2019s support in exporting its grain. Poland\u2019s opposition parties were quick to pounce on this week\u2019s uncertainty over weapons shipments.  Radek Sikorski, a Member of the European Parliament and previously Poland\u2019s defense and foreign minister, told CNN that \u201cincompetence is at play\u201d regarding the latest spat.  \u201cThe government failed in organizing transit corridors for Ukrainian grain to Africa and China,\u201d Sikorski said, adding that \u201cif Poland had a better relationship with Brussels, it could\u2019ve all been done a year ago.\u201d  What does this mean for the war? While Warsaw\u2019s position on weapons remains unclear, any reversal in Polish military and strategic support for Ukraine would have major consequences. Poland has been among the most eager nations to bolster Kyiv\u2019s arsenal since the initial days of the full-scale war, and has shown a willingness to push other European powers and the US into joining them. In January, when Germany agonized over whether to provide Leopard 2 battle tanks to Kyiv\u2019s troops, Poland took a leading role in bringing together a European coalition that gave Berlin enough leeway to make the move.  For days, Polish officials talked up publicly and privately their desire to get the high-tech combat vehicles onto the front lines, and insisted they would do so whether or not fellow nations came with them. Kyiv and its allies will have concerns that if Warsaw takes a new attitude to future arms shipments, other hesitant European countries will feel less pressure to also donate supplies. So, even if this dispute is resolved and shipments continue to Kyiv as before, the episode has brought lessons to both countries. Poland would be hesitant to anger NATO and the United States \u2013 its two crucial security partners \u2013 by reducing the flow of weapons onto the front lines. But its domestic political context has pressed PiS into taking a firmer line on Kyiv, and a close or ambiguous electoral result next month may lengthen the tightrope the party is walking. But Zelensky\u2019s tough words for Poland this week have also highlighted the risks of pushing his allies\u2019 buttons too forcefully. His UNGA speech clearly angered many in Warsaw, and the longer the grain dispute continues, the more likely spats between Kyiv and its nearest ally will become.", "source": "CNN", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T13:00:57Z"}, {"urlToImage": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230920002212-01-trudeau-modi-090923-file.jpg?c=original", "title": "Canada and India are enmeshed in an unprecedented diplomatic row. Here\u2019s how it happened", "content": "An explosive allegation from Canada that the Indian government may have been behind the assassination of a Sikh separatist activist on Canadian soil has triggered a huge diplomatic row and sent relations between the two plummeting.  It all started on Monday, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed he has credible information linking India to the killing of prominent Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar.  Canada\u2019s allegation outraged India, which has vehemently denied the claim, calling it \u201cabsurd and motivated.\u201d  Both Canada and India acted swiftly to expel senior diplomats in reciprocal moves earlier this week. And on Thursday, India\u2019s foreign ministry responded by temporarily suspending visa services for Canadian citizens over what it said are \u201csecurity threats\u201d against diplomats in Canada.  Trudeau on Thursday called on India to \u201cwork with\u201d Canada and \u201callow justice to follow its course.\u201d Experts say the falling out raises the prospect of an unprecedented rift between two key partners of the United States, and puts other major Western countries in an uncomfortable position.  Here\u2019s what you need to know.   What are the two sides saying? Trudeau claimed in Parliament on Monday that Canadian authorities had been investigating \u201ccredible allegations\u201d of a potential link between \u201cagents of the government of India\u201d and the killing of Nijjar, a Sikh Canadian citizen who was gunned down by masked men in June.  Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister Melanie Joly subsequently said that Ottawa had expelled an Indian diplomat, whom she described as the head of the Indian intelligence agency in the country, as a \u201cconsequence.\u201d India responded hours later by rejecting Trudeau\u2019s allegations, accusing Canada of harboring terrorists and claiming its inaction against extremists had been a \u201clong-standing\u201d concern. It also expelled a senior Canadian diplomat from the country. Nijjar\u2019s death in June shocked the Sikh community in Canada, one of the largest outside India with more than 770,000 members. Following Trudeau\u2019s comments, two Sikh community groups in Canada \u2013 the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council and Ontario Gurdwaras Committee \u2013 urged the Canadian government to \u201cimmediately suspend all intelligence, investigative and prosecutorial cooperation with India.\u201d \u201cCanada\u2019s comprehensive response must reflect the gravity of India\u2019s role in the premeditated murder of a Sikh dissident living in Canada,\u201d the groups added in a joint statement. On Tuesday, Trudeau doubled down on the allegations. He said Canada wasn\u2019t trying to \u201cprovoke\u201d India or \u201cescalate\u201d the situation, but was \u201csimply laying out the facts,\u201d adding that his government will \u201cfollow the evidence and make sure that the work is done to hold people to account.\u201d Who was Hardeep Singh Nijjar?  Nijjar was an outspoken supporter of the creation of a separate Sikh homeland known as Khalistan, which would include parts of India\u2019s Punjab state.  The Khalistan movement is outlawed in India and considered a national security threat by the government. A number of groups associated with the movement are listed as \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d under India\u2019s Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Nijjar\u2019s name appears on the Home Ministry\u2019s list of UAPA terrorists and in 2020, the Indian National Investigation Agency accused him of \u201ctrying to radicalize the Sikh community across the world in favor of the creation of \u2018Khalistan,\u2019\u201d adding that he had been \u201ctrying to incite Sikhs to vote for secession, agitate against the government of India and carry out violent activities.\u201d  Nijjar\u2019s friend and former lawyer, who also appears on India\u2019s UAPA wanted list, said Nijjar was warned at least three times by Canadian authorities including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police about threats to his life. Gurpatwant Singh Pannun told CNN that Nijjar was asked to be careful and avoid giving \u201cbig talks\u201d or he would be targeted. CNN has reached out to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Pannun, who faces multiple charges from the Indian government, runs a New York-based outfit called \u201cSikhs for Justice,\u201d which has held referendums for a separate Khalistan state. The organization is considered unlawful in India, where its website is not accessible. Canadian police have not arrested anyone in connection with Nijjar\u2019s murder. But in an August update, police said they were investigating three suspects and issued a description of a possible getaway vehicle. Can relations return to where they were? Relations between the two countries have been tepid for several years and Canada\u2019s allegations against the Indian government has further soured things.  Harsh Pant, vice president of foreign policy at the New Delhi based think tank Observer Research Foundation, called the situation \u201cquite extraordinary.\u201d  \u201cFriendly nations don\u2019t do this to each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenges (that arise from this) are something to be seen because I don\u2019t see any light, at least in the short term, at the end of the tunnel.\u201d  Negotiations for a trade deal between the countries have been paused due to issues \u201cof serious concern,\u201d India\u2019s commerce and trade minister said, according to local reports. When Modi hosted the Group of 20 (G20) leaders in New Delhi this month, he did not meet Trudeau one-on-one but on the sidelines of the summit, where the Indian leader \u201cconveyed our strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada,\u201d according to the Indian government.  Tensions have been \u201csimmering under the surface for a while,\u201d Pant said. When Trudeau visited India in 2018, his calendar, which was light on diplomatic meetings, was seen by many as a \u201csnub\u201d from New Delhi. A year earlier, the Canadian leader had been seen at a Sikh event in Toronto where separatist flags and posters depicting an extremist Sikh leader killed in a 1984 Indian Army operation were displayed. In its statement on Tuesday, the Indian government said: \u201cThat Canadian political figures have openly expressed sympathy for such elements remains a matter of deep concern.\u201d On Thursday, India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs said it was halting issuing visas to Canadian citizens, blaming \u201csecurity threats.\u201d \u201cThe issue is of incitement of violence, the inaction by the Canadian authorities, the creation of an environment that disrupts the functioning our high commission and consulates, that\u2019s what\u2019s making us stop temporarily the issuance of visas or providing visa services,\u201d the ministry\u2019s spokesman, Arindam Bagchi, told reporters in New Delhi on Thursday.  Despite all this, Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, said he thinks the \u201crelationship is salvageable.\u201d  He said: \u201cCanada is a top investor in India and also (has) a very large Indian diaspora in Canada. And people to people relations are very strong on the whole.\u201d  How have others responded? Canada\u2019s allegations come days after Modi hosted world leaders including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Australia\u2019s Anthony Albanese for the G20 summit in New Delhi.  Each of those countries has a sizable Sikh population and are keen for warm relations with New Delhi, in part as a buttress against the growing assertiveness of China.  However, those three key allies of Canada issued statements that indicated some support for Trudeau\u2019s decision to go public with his concerns.   The White House is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the allegations, National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said, adding it was \u201ccritical that Canada\u2019s investigations proceed and the perpetrators be brought to justice.\u201d A spokesperson for Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the country is also \u201cdeeply concerned.\u201d  \u201cWe understand these reports will be particularly concerning to some Australian communities,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe Indian diaspora are valued and important contributors to our vibrant and resilient multicultural society, where all Australians can peacefully and safely express their views.\u201d Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the British prime minister said, \u201cIt\u2019s right that the Canadian authorities are looking into (the matter), but I\u2019m not going to get ahead of that work that needs to take place now.\u201d Kugelman said Canada would\u2019ve \u201cgone through a very extensive process\u201d to investigate the allegations. \u201cIt counts on very close intelligence relationships with the US and the UK and Australia among others,\u201d he said.  Kugelman added it was \u201cnotable\u201d that Canada is a member of the so-called Five Eyes, an intelligence pact that also includes the United States, Britain and Australia and New Zealand.  \u201cIndeed, one would think that Canada would\u2019ve had to undertake a significant, careful investigation before being willing and comfortable to make these allegations public,\u201d he added.
