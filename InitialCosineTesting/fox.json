Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wants to narrow in on China\u2019s influence in the U.S. in a new bill he is introducing Thursday that prohibits Chinese migrants with ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from obtaining asylum. Rubio\u2019s No Asylum for CCP Spies Act, obtained first by Fox News Digital, would only grant asylum to nationals if they have: publicly renounced their CCP or totalitarian alliance; can prove their membership was by force or when the migrant was younger than 16 years old; or solely for the purpose of obtaining employment or food rations; or the Pentagon determines the migrant is not a danger to national security. \"The American people are facing the repercussions of the Biden Administration\u2019s open border policy, which is creating chaos and putting our communities at risk,\" Rubio, a senior member of the Foreign Relations Committee, told Fox News Digital in a statement. He added, \"We don\u2019t know who\u2019s illegally entering our nation. This presents an opportunity for the Chinese Communist Party to further take advantage and threaten our democracy and national security interests.\" MARCO RUBIO LEADS EFFORT TO BLOCK BIDEN MOVE PROTECTING CHINESE EV COMPANIES  So far in fiscal year 2023, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered nearly 40,000 Chinese nationals on both the southern and northern borders, far surpassing the approximately 23,500 and 27,800 encountered in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, respectively. In July, more than 6,000 crossed the border, just two months after the COVID-19-era rule that allowed for expelling illegal migrants quickly \u2013 known as Title 42 \u2013 expired. \"Much of the increase in migration from China is certainly a result of President Biden\u2019s failed border policies,\" Rubio\u2019s office noted. \"With that, the CCP has proven savvy in their attempts to pervert American generosity, especially as it relates to visas, and inconsistencies within current U.S. asylum law are likely to be exacerbated and exploited as a result of increased Chinese migration.\" RAMASWAMY UNVEILS PLAN TO 'DECLARE ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE FROM CHINA' IN UPCOMING POLICY SPEECH  The bill's sponsors include GOP Sens. Roger Marshall of Kansas, Rick Scott of Florida, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Mike Braun of Indiana, Pete Ricketts of Nebraska, and Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. The House will introduce companion legislation authored by Republican Reps. Mark Green of Tennessee, Troy Nehls of Texas and Byron Donalds of Florida.

Kathy Hochul's new law expanding early mail-in voting ahead of the 2024 election.&nbsp; House GOP Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and a Republican and Conservative coalition that includes members of the New York Republican Congressional delegation, sued Hochul and the State of New York Wednesday \"for attempting to remove basic safeguards on absentee voting and allowing unregulated mass mail ballots in clear violation of the state constitution.\"&nbsp; The lawsuit was announced immediately after Hochul signed the Early Mail Voter Act into law Wednesday. The law came as part of a new legislative package that Hochul billed as working to \"strengthen democracy and protect voting rights in New York State.\" \"Kathy Hochul and extreme New York Democrats are trying to destroy what is left of election integrity in New York,\" Stefanik said in a statement. \"Under Kathy Hochul\u2019s failed leadership, elections are less secure and less transparent and will now be unconstitutional.\"&nbsp; OBAMA PRAISES PENNSYLVANIA AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION IN KEY SWING STATE AS CONSERVATIVES CRY FOUL  The governor\u2019s legislative package allows absentee ballots to be counted if they\u2019ve been taped and show no signs of tampering and also creates a Golden Day, on the first day of early voting, when New Yorkers can register to vote and cast their ballots at their polling places the same day.&nbsp; \"Our laws are going to modernize and improve every step of the process from registering to casting your ballot to the Electoral College. It includes a law that\u2019ll allow every New Yorker to vote early by mail,\" Hochul said at a press conference Wednesday. The governor's office billed the law as a \"significant expansion of ballot access in New York State\" providing millions of New York voters \"with an easy, safe, and secure means of voting early by mail ballot.\"&nbsp; Democratic assemblywoman Karine Reyes even celebrated how by allowing voters to cast their ballots by mail, \"we remove a critical barrier that voters face in having their voices heard: making time to physically go to their specific polling place and cast a ballot.\"&nbsp; But Republicans argue in their lawsuit that it violates the state constitution, which allows absentee ballots only for voters with a medical or physical disability or proof they\u2019ll be out of their county of residence or New York City on Election Day. The law, the lawsuit says, will impose substantial administrative and financial burdens on county election boards, as well as candidates targeting voter outreach and mobilization campaigns to encourage people to show up in person at the polls on Election Day.&nbsp; Hochul\u2019s office says the law establishes a system for early voting by mail allowing all eligible, registered New York voters the opportunity to vote early by mail \"in advance of an election.\" Under the law, a new application process will be developed to facilitate voter requests for early mail ballots, and voters will be able to request mail ballots up to ten days prior to the election in which they would like to vote early by mail. Boards of election will then be required to provide mail ballots with postage-paid return envelopes to all eligible and registered voters.&nbsp; Early mail ballots must then be mailed back to the appropriate board of elections no later than Election Day and must be received by the board no later than seven days after Election Day.&nbsp;  GOV.

Rather than work to stem the flow of our most productive taxpaying citizens out of the state, radical progressives are working to manipulate elections in their favor in their pursuit of power at all costs.\" National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson alleged that New York Democrats \"are more focused on rigging the rules than winning on issues.\"&nbsp; \"Instead of working to stop crime, lower inflation and ensure parents\u2019 rights in schools, they stick to their extreme policies that New Yorkers rejected once and will again in 2024,\" he added.&nbsp;  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"New Yorkers had a chance to vote on this policy in 2021, and they overwhelmingly rejected it,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said. \"The RNC and its partners are stepping in because Kathy Hochul and New York Democrats are ignoring the outcome of that vote to push an unconstitutional attack on mail-in voting safeguards.

Both countries have recalled their ambassadors following those comments. It would not be the first time that L\u00f3pez Obrador has skipped international meetings in the United States because of who else was or wasn't invited. Last year, he skipped the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles because Nicaragua and Venezuela were not invited.

MEXICAN PRESIDENT ANDR\u00c9S MANUEL L\u00d3PEZ OBRADOR TESTS POSITIVE FOR THE CORONAVIRUS FOR 3RD TIME L\u00f3pez Obrador's comments were the most forceful indication yet that he doesn\u2019t recognize current Peruvian President Dina Boluarte. Boluarte took office in 2022 after then-President Castillo was removed by Parliament and jailed after trying to dissolve Congress to avoid a vote on his removal from office. Castillo, who was Peru\u2019s first leader from a rural Andean background, was plagued by corruption scandals and a revolving-door Cabinet.  In February, Boluarte withdrew her country\u2019s ambassador in response to the comments by L\u00f3pez Obrador, and Mexico's ambassador was declared persona non grata.

Staff reporter Quentin M\u00fcller and freelancer photojournalist Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Di Campo, who work for the weekly Marianne magazine, said on Wednesday that they were taken by force from their Casablanca hotel room by 10 plainclothes police officers and put on the first flight to Paris. Both M\u00fcller and St\u00e9phane Aubouard, an editor at Marianne, said the expulsions were politically motivated in response to critical reporting. Morocco denied the charge and said their removal was about procedure, not politics. However, media activists framed it as the latest action taken by Moroccan authorities against journalists. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, M\u00fcller linked their expulsions to broader concerns about retaliation against journalists in Morocco. US HOUSE PASSES BILL PRESERVING SOUTH DAKOTA\u2019S WOUNDED KNEE MASSACRE SITE \"We were removed and forcibly expelled from the country without any explanation.

In a subsequent op-ed, Aubouard said the two went to Morocco following this month's devastating earthquake that killed nearly 3,000 people. He said the expulsions \"confirm the difficulty that foreign and local journalists have working in the country.\" Morocco has garnered some international condemnation in recent years for what many see as its efforts to infringe on press freedoms. At least three Moroccan journalists who have reported critically on government actions are in prison, convicted of crimes unrelated to journalism. The Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders both denounced the expulsions on X, with the latter describing them as a \"brutal and inadmissible attack on press freedom.\" Moroccan government spokesperson Mustapha Baitas said on Thursday the expulsions were a matter of procedure, not politics. He said that neither journalist had sought accreditation, which is required by journalists under Moroccan law.  Baitas said M\u00fcller and Di Campo entered the country as tourists. \"They neither requested accreditation nor declared their intent to engage in journalistic activities,\" he told reporters at a news conference in Rabat on Thursday. \"Our nation firmly upholds the values of freedom and transparency and is committed to enabling all journalists to perform their duties with absolute freedom,\" he added. The expulsions come amid broader criticism of French media in Morocco. In a separate development Wednesday, Morocco\u2019s National Press Board published a formal complaint to France\u2019s Council for Journalistic Ethics and Mediation against two media outlets, the satiric weekly Charlie Hebdo and the daily Lib\u00e9ration, saying their reporting had violated ethical norms and spread fake news while attacking Morocco and its institutions for their earthquake response.

The father angrily closed the door after one of the officers told him his daughter could face charges for producing or recording child sexual abuse images despite being a victim. The parent posted to TikTok a now-viral security video of the conversation, which has generated widespread criticism of the police\u2019s response. The officers' conduct is being investigated, as well as any crime that may have been committed against the girl, Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement late Tuesday.

He tells the officers his daughter is already asleep, and that he had hoped they could help talk to her about the seriousness of the situation. The female officer quickly tells him that his daughter could be charged with creating sexually explicit content. The father protests and says that she is a child who was manipulated by an adult, according to the police report and the father's TikTok video. The officer asks him if she was taking pictures, and the father ends the conversation. In audio of the body camera footage, the female officer can be heard asserting again as she walks away from the house, \"She\u2019s taking pictures of herself naked. She\u2019s creating child porn.\" In a preliminary incident report, the officer lists the possible charge under investigation as \"pandering sexually oriented material involving a minor\" for creating or producing material, and cites a portion of the Ohio law that prohibits the creation, recording or publishing of child sexual abuse materials. A separate portion of the law that wasn\u2019t cited prohibits knowingly soliciting, receiving, purchasing or possessing that material. 3 FORMER COLUMBUS ZOO EXECS INDICTED IN $2.2M CORRUPTION SCHEME FOLLOWING AUDIT REVEALING IMPROPER SPENDING&nbsp; In a statement Tuesday, the police chief repeatedly referred to the 11-year-old as the victim of a crime. She said that the officers' conduct did not live up to her expectations that officers \"treat every victim of crime with compassion, decency and dignity.\" What records show The AP also obtained the audio from the father's police call and a dispatch log with notes called in from the responding officers. According to the dispatch log, the father called 911 around 6:50 p.m. on Sept. 14, and was told they would send a female officer. He called again at about 7:50 p.m. to say the response was taking too long. Officers showed up at the family's home more than five hours later, after midnight on Sept. 15. Video footage shows the father informing the officers his daughter is asleep and saying he wasn\u2019t sure what they could do.  The police report identifies the officers as Kelsie Schneider and Brian Weiner. A number listed for Schneider went straight to voicemail. Weiner answered a call but asked a reporter not to contact him. The notes from officers in the log and in the incident report place blame on the father for ending the conversation before they could discuss possible outcomes, saying he became \"immediately upset.\" Remaining questions Despite the police chief's statement referring to the child as a victim, Columbus police have not responded to questions about whether she could still face charges.

The thresholds have been rising for each ensuing debate. To make the first showdown, a Fox News-hosted event in Milwaukee on Aug. 23, the candidates needed to hit 1% in polling and have 40,000 donors. Eight candidates ended up facing off in Milwaukee. THESE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE SCRAMBLING TO QUALIFY FOR NEXT WEEK'S SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE The criteria were raised to 3% in the polls and 50,000 donors for next week's second debate, a FOX Business-hosted showdown taking place Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California. So far, according to a Fox News count, six of the eight candidates who took part in last month's first GOP presidential nomination debate have already reached the RNC's criteria.  They are \u2014 in alphabetical order \u2014 former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, biotech entrepreneur and political commentator Vivek Ramaswamy, and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.

Former President Donald Trump, who has reached the donor and polling thresholds, did not sign the RNC's pledge. Pointing to his large lead over his rivals for the nomination, he did not attend the first debate and has already made alternate plans for next week's showdown.

The RNC's debate committee decided \u2014 in consultation with RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel \u2014 during a Thursday conference call to issue a warning that it will pull a planned GOP presidential primary debate in New Hampshire if the state leapfrogs Iowa caucuses and moves to the top of the party's nominating calendar. Sources with knowledge of the call shared the decision with Fox News Digital.&nbsp; Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, in an exclusive statement to Fox News a couple of hours later, responded to the RNC. \"The first presidential primary will be taking place in New Hampshire, regardless of what the political power brokers in Washington, DC think,\" Sununu wrote. \"We will not be threatened, we will follow our law, and we WILL go first. End of story.\"&nbsp; New Hampshire for a century has held the first primary in the race for the White House, and for the past half century has gone second in both the Democratic and Republican nominating calendars, following Iowa's caucuses. While the Republican National Committee is not making any dramatic changes to their nominating calendar, the rival Democratic National Committee overwhelmingly voted in early February to dramatically alter the top of its schedule for the 2024 election cycle, bumping Iowa and New Hampshire from their longtime leadoff positions. THE RNC'S RAISING THE BAR FOR THE CANDIDATES TO MAKE THE STAGE AT THE THIRD PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE  According to a nominating calendar proposed by President Biden and approved by the DNC, South Carolina will hold the Democrats' first primary, on Feb. 3, followed three days later by New Hampshire and Nevada. But New Hampshire has a nearly half-century-old law that mandates that it hold the first presidential primary, a week ahead of any similar contest. And it's likely the state will hold its primary on Jan. 23, eight days after Iowa's caucuses, which are scheduled for Jan. 15. While that would put New Hampshire in non-compliance with the Democrats, it wouldn't affect the GOP primary. THESE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE SCRAMBLING TO QUALIFY FOR NEXT WEEK'S SECOND PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE But Iowa Democrats \u2014 who last week voted to also hold their caucuses along with the Republicans on Jan. 15 \u2014 are considering complementing their traditional caucus with a mail-in component, which New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan warns may make the Iowa Democratic caucuses too similar to a primary, violating the Granite State's law. The possible move by Iowa Democrats would also violate a new Hawkeye State law that mandates that the caucuses be held in person.  Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann&nbsp;recently charged in a radio interview that Scanlan was being \"over-rambunctious\" in potentially moving up the date of the primary. Scanlan returned fire last week, telling reporters that \"we're going to take a pretty hard line on any effort to make a traditional caucus look more like a presidential primary.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The RNC is planning on holding debates in all four of its early voting presidential primary and caucus states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina \u2014 ahead of their contests.  But the RNC is now warning New Hampshire that a jump to the top of the calendar ahead of Iowa would result in the state's debate being pulled by the national party committee. Sununu, who's been very vocal in criticizing the DNC's push to move New Hampshire from the top primary position, on Thursday evening fired back at the RNC over their possible pulling of their debate. \"New Hampshire gives every candidate an even playing field and can catapult candidates to the presidency. Threatening to take a debate away from New Hampshire is a disservice to every campaign and candidate that has worked tirelessly to earn the votes of New Hampshire\u2019s Republican electorate,\" Sununu worte in his statement to Fox News. And Scanlan also dismissed the RNC warning, saying it would not enter his decision-making process. Asked by the NH Journal if it would impact the date of the primary, New Hampshire's Secretary of State answered,\"In a word, \u2018no.\u2019\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T15:59:38-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/james-comer-kjp.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Comer pushes back on Karine Jean-Pierre calling impeachment \u2018baseless\u2019: \u2018We have mountains of evidence\u2019", "content": "Kentucky Rep.

JAMES COMER: I have no idea what she means. There are one or two disgruntled Republicans that are trying to claim there's no evidence. But at the end of the day, the majority of Americans, poll after poll shows, they realize there are mountains of evidence. Let's start with the fact that we've discovered the Biden family has taken in over $20 million from foreign nationals that came through a series of shell companies that were then laundered down to the Bidens in incremental payments. My question to the White House is, what did the Bidens do to receive that $20 million? They can't answer it. They try to act like it didn't happen, like it didn't exist, but it did. $20 million. We heard from the IRS whistle-blowers that they didn't pay a penny of taxes on this money, that this investigation was leading to Joe Biden. We found even though Joe Biden said he never met with or spoke to or had any knowledge of any of these people who were mysteriously wiring millions of dollars to the Bidens, we have found through our deposition process that he spoke to every one of them on the phone over a dozen times. So there are mountains of evidence. We can talk about the text messages, the emails. We can talk about the bank receipts and that's what we're going to talk about next week in our first impeachment inquiry hearing.

Michelle Lujan Grisham last week tried to enact an immediate 30-day prohibition on carrying guns in public areas or on state-owned properties in Albuquerque, calling gun violence a public health crisis. \"Many said that public health emergencies would not be abused to impose gun control, but after we saw the vast expansion of executive power during COVID and the New Mexico governor use a public health emergency to effectively suspend the Second Amendment in her state, no one can doubt that this needs to be addressed,\" Braun said in a statement. \"We need to set into law that no one can remove the right to defend ourselves and our families with the stroke of a pen.\" HOUSE REPUBLICAN MOVES TO PROTECT GUN OWNERS' RIGHTS FROM 'RADICAL LEFT' NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS  The legislation is likely to gain steam in the GOP-led House.

Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and others announced the return of the seven artworks to the family of Fritz Gr\u00fcnbaum, an Austrian-Jewish cabaret performer whose art collection was stolen by the Nazi regime. The collection consisted of drawings from Austrian artist Egon Schiele, which were seized by the New York DA's Antiquities Tracking Unit this year from the Museum of Modern Art; the Ronald Lauder Collection; the Morgan Library; the Santa Barbara Museum of Art; and the Vally Sabarsky Trust in Manhattan.

The evidence presented to the institutions to regain possession of the arts showed that Gr\u00fcnbaum owned hundreds of pieces of art, including over 80 Schiele drawings.  Gr\u00fcnbaum was captured by the Nazis in 1938, when they invaded Austria, and when he was in custody, he gave power of attorney to his wife, Elisabeth Gr\u00fcnbaum, who was compelled to hand over the full collection to Nazis. The whole collection was inventoried by Nazi party member Franz Kieslinger before being impounded in a Nazi-controlled warehouse in September 1938. The works were auctioned or sold to finance the Nazi Party, and their whereabouts were unknown after World War II until the 1950s, when they reappeared at a Swiss Auction House, Gutekunst &amp; Klipstein. NAVY VETERAN AIRMAN, AGE 100, FLIES AGAIN ON VINTAGE WORLD WAR II PILOT-TRAINING BIPLANE Hitler\u2019s personal art curator, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was given authorization to sell degenerate artwork that was seized by the Nazi Government. Decades after the war, Eberhard Kornfeld, the owner of Gutekunst &amp; Klipstein, received hundreds of Nazi-looted artworks stolen from Holocaust victims from Gurlitt\u2019s son, Cornelius.  Kornfeld sold most of Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s Schiele drawings to Otto Kallir in 1956, who was the owner of the New York City-based Gallery Galerie St. Etienne.

Mitt Romney, and, last month, endorsed businessman Bernie Moreno's efforts to unseat vulnerable Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio. Lake has also boosted Trump on the campaign trail, including at events in Wisconsin, Texas and Iowa \u2014 the state she was raised. According to sources close to Lake, she will also travel to California next week as a surrogate for Trump at the second Republican presidential debate hosted by Fox Business. Trump will not be participating, and will instead speak at an event in Michigan. TRUMP SAYS HE WILL CARRY OUT THE \u2018LARGEST DOMESTIC DEPORTATION OPERATION IN AMERICAN HISTORY\u2019 IF ELECTED  Early polls have suggested Lake would be the front-runner in a hypothetical Republican primary. The only major Republican candidate in the race so far is Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb, who launched his campaign in April. Republican businessman Blake Masters, who lost to Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly in last year's race, has also been mentioned as a potential candidate.&nbsp; Democrat Congressman Ruben Gallego, whose district encompasses a large portion of the deep-blue Phoenix area, is currently considered the front-runner for his party's nomination in the race. Meanwhile, Sinema has still not officially said whether she will attempt an independent run for re-election after leaving the Democrat Party last year. Sources close to Lake have also pointed to polling showing Trump edging President Biden in a hypothetical 2024 matchup as evidence she would perform well against Gallego in the general election. DEMOCRAT LAWMAKER REVEALS THE PARTY'S \u2018NIGHTMARE SCENARIO\u2019 FOR BIDEN AND 2024  Lake first gained nationwide name recognition last year with her gubernatorial run against now-Democrat Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs. She narrowly lost to Hobbs by just over 17,000 votes out of the nearly 2.6 million cast, but has maintained there was an amount of voter fraud significant enough to help put the Democrat over the finish line.

They have either called out Russia by name, referred to unspecified world conflicts, or spoken about the inability of the U.N. to confront Moscow or its leaders.&nbsp; In his Wednesday speech, Lithuanian President Gitanas Naus\u0117da said Russia had brought back \"an old-style colonial war\" to Europe.&nbsp; Slovak President Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 accused Russian forces of committing war crimes. \"For more than 570 days, Russia's forces have been killing innocent Ukrainian civilians, kidnapping children, and destroying towns and cities,\" she said.&nbsp; RUSSIA ASSAILED BY ALBANIAN PM AFTER FAILED ATTEMPT TO PREVENT UKRAINE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY FROM SPEAKING AT US  Finnish President Sauli Niinisto said Moscow's \"aggression is a direct violation of the United Nations Charter, to which we are all committed by aiding Ukraine.\" \"It exacerbated all these crises of various kinds and destroyed not only thousands of human lives but also the optimism that we are able to build back better,\" said Bulgarian President Rumen Radevn. Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics was even more blunt. \"Russia must bear full legal and financial responsibility for its aggression,\" he said. \"We must ensure complete accountability for all crimes committed in Ukraine. It means the responsibility of Russia as a state for violations of international law.\" WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE OUR SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE  On Tuesday, President Biden asked: \"If we allow Ukraine to be carved up, is the independence of any nation secure?\" Leaders from Poland, Portugal, Hungry, Uruguay, the Czech Republic and many others also weighed in on the war. Many said the conflict has strained regional stability and impacted diplomatic relations between nations.&nbsp; Russia has been almost universally condemned for its February 2022 invasion. Since the fighting began, thousands are estimated to have been killed on both sides.&nbsp; On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in New York to address the U.N. Security Council, where he advocated for international assistance in helping his country fend off Russian forces. He also spoke at the General Assembly.&nbsp; He accused Russia of weaponizing food, energy to abducted children in its war against his country.&nbsp; \"When hatred is weaponized against one nation, it never stops there,\" he said. \"The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into weapons against you \u2014 against the international rules-based order.\"  On Wednesday, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama called out Russia over attempts to prevent Zelenskyy from speaking at the U.N. Security Council. He noted that the notice of speaking orders was given in advance and any objections should have been raised beforehand. RUSSIAN TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM NORWAY BORDER IN DROP SINCE START OF UKRAINE WAR: OFFICIAL \"I want to assure our Russian colleagues and everyone here that this is not a special operation by the Albanian presidency,\" Rama said, referring to Moscow's wording of its invasion in Ukraine.&nbsp; In response, Vassily Nebenzia, the Russian ambassador to the U.N., said Albania had placed its \"political and ideological beliefs above the obligations\" of the council.&nbsp; \"I must say that coming from all these lectures of violating the rules in this building is quite an impressive show,\" Rama replied. \"But as far as you repeat it many times that the violation here is about President Zelenskyy speaking before the council members, there is a solution for this.

Republicans hold a slim majority and only a few holdout votes can derail the process completely. House Republicans tried last week to bring the defense spending plan for debate. But the GOP set that aside because they lacked the votes. Then they tried to approve the \"rule\" for the defense bill Tuesday. That went up in flames.

That plan was dead on arrival by Tuesday.&nbsp; Republicans huddled for over two hours Wednesday night on a bill to temporarily fund the government, pass additional appropriations bills, cut spending and create a commission to study the debt. That plan \u2014 purportedly set for debate on Saturday \u2014 is on life support at best.&nbsp;  The failed vote also seemed unexpected, since GOP lawmakers emerged from a closed-door conference meeting on Wednesday evening expressing confidence that they could pass a 30-day stopgap spending deal to avoid a shutdown while passing a series of individual spending bills \u2014 only one of which has passed so far.&nbsp; The setbacks this week mark a bad omen that a government shutdown could be a fait accompli \u2014 simply because Republicans can\u2019t do anything about it.

RECORD-BREAKING FISH: HUGE CATCHES THAT MADE HEADLINES IN 2022&nbsp; While the fish seems to have evolved for camouflaging, rock greenlings have blue or blue-green mouths and flesh, according to both wildlife agencies. Scientists aren\u2019t certain why rock greenlings have blue-green pigments in their tissue, but they know the coloring happens because the fish biologically produce biliverdin, a green bile, according to the Oregon Sea Grant, a marine research foundation. Rock greenlings feed on sea worms, crustaceans, and small fishes, according to the California Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife.

The votes come as 300 nominees remained in limbo due to Tuberville\u2019s six-month hold over the Pentagon\u2019s abortion policy, which covers some expenses for military personnel seeking to terminate a pregnancy. Tuberville recognizes the abortion policy may not ever change now that votes are rolling, but \"they're going to hear a lot about it between now and November of next year,\" he said. \"We're getting ready to get into an election year, and we're going to be pushing that very hard,\" Tuberville said.&nbsp; BIDEN ADMIN BLASTS 'DANGEROUS' TUBERVILLE MILITARY NOMINATION HOLDS BUT BLOCKS ALTERNATE PATH FORWARD  Tuberville, a retired college football coach, said in an August statement that the hold, which began in February, has given him \"more time to look more closely into the background of some these nominees,\" which has prompted \"deep concerns.\" At the time, Tuberville's office pointed to an op-ed by Col.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., recently announced that the Senate would no longer enforce a dress code, allowing Fetterman, and any other senator, to show up to work in the outfit of their choosing. Visitors and others entering the chamber are, however, not off of the hook, and must appear in the proper business attire. The change was immediately blasted as \"pathetic,\" with many lawmakers accusing Schumer of changing the rules solely for fellow Democrat Fetterman, who did not adhere to them for months.  \"The U.S. Senate just eliminated its dress code because you got this guy from Pennsylvania \u2014 who's got a lot of problems\u2026 he wears, like, sweatshirts and hoodies and shorts\u2026 we need to be lifting up our standards in this country, not dumbing down,\" presidential candidate Gov.

BIDEN IGNORES BORDER CRISIS AT UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY  \"[The media] is starting to wake up to it because it's coming everywhere: every town, every city, every community is seeing it because the volume, the number, is so darn high, including\u2026 the mayor of New York City, who's not a conservative Republican \u2014 he just sees what's happening to that great city,\" said Jordan. \"[Adams] sees all the people coming in and how [the city] can't handle it, the tax base can't handle it, but Joe Biden doesn't seem to care.\" He said Jean-Pierre is similarly uninterested in the crisis, while claiming Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas continues to stonewall transparency by declining to provide information requested by Republican lawmakers. Jordan told \"The Story\" that Biden's border policies aren't failing, but they're doing exactly what they're intended to do. \"What kind of country doesn't have a border? A country run by Joe Biden.

On \"The Howard Stern Show\" on Tuesday, the host called Maher\u2019s comments \"nutty\" and \"sexist,\" saying that the \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" star \"ought to shut his mouth.\" Stern added he assumes the two aren\u2019t friends anymore in light of Maher\u2019s comments. The words that set Stern off came during Sunday's episode of the Maher\u2019s \"Club Random\" podcast, during which late musician John Lennon\u2019s son, Julian, was a guest. HOWARD STERN \u2018DUMBFOUNDED\u2019 BY KID ROCK'S BUD LIGHT PROTEST: \u2018WHY ARE YOU SO UPSET OVER THIS?\u2019  Maher made the comments after recounting to Lennon how Stern told him in the past that he needed to \"settle down\" and get married. According to the host, Stern was on his HBO show \"right before the pandemic\" and told him, \"'Bill, you know, you're successful, but don't you wanna settle down?'\" Maher continued, \"And he goes on about how much he loves his wife, Beth, which he has been doing on the air for, like, 10 years. But we know Howard had this other wife before Beth. So he's trying to make me seem like I'm the slightly immoral one 'cause I wouldn't settle down.\" He then rebuked the way that Stern has allegedly talked about his second wife, Beth Stern, whom the radio shock jock has been married to since 2008. Maher suggested that the way Stern fawns over his current wife must make his first wife feel uncomfortable. Maher asked, \"How does this gushing about the second wife \u2014 how does that make the first wife feel? Could we just not gush about the person while the other person can still hear it?\" Stern and his first wife, Alison Berns, married in 1978 and divorced in 2001. The XM Sirius host responded to Maher\u2019s comments on air. He first paraphrased them, saying, \"Basically, he says, 'Howard Stern always gets on the radio and says he loves his wife.' I've never been criticized for this. He goes, 'Haven't we had enough of that? What about his first wife? I feel really bad for her.'\" Stern then judged the comments, stating, \"What a sexist thing to say. Like, what a convoluted, nutty thing to say. It\u2019s assuming that he knows something about my first marriage. That, of course, the man must be leaving the woman and the woman must be devastated and be sitting around pining away for her famous man.\"&nbsp; HOWARD STERN'S MOST MEMORABLE MOMENTS SINCE PIVOT FROM SHOCK JOCK TO LIBERAL MOUTHPIECE  Stern had more to say about it, urging Maher to refrain from the subject.&nbsp; \"He ought to shut his mouth. I mean, I don\u2019t think I come on the air every day and say, 'I love my wife.' But I thought it was a pretty positive message, to \u2014 especially with my audience \u2014 to say to guys: \u2018Instead of, like, ragging on our wives, how about talking about that we appreciate them and love them?\u2019\" Stern said.&nbsp; The radio host remarked that Maher seemed like he was \"very worried about my relationship.\" Stern then told his audience that he sent Maher a direct email, telling the comedian to give him marital advice directly instead of gossiping about it on his podcast.&nbsp; \"I wrote in an email, I said, 'Why don\u2019t you give me a phone call? Why don\u2019t you tell me what you think about my life and my marriage since you\u2019re, you know.' But, of course, he never wrote me back,\" he said.&nbsp; Stern elaborated that he sent the email because he \"wanted to see how brave\" Maher was and \"if he was brave enough to call me and actually get on the phone with me, and zero response. I don\u2019t care, though. He can think what he wants.\" \"I think I\u2019m no longer friends with him,\" he added.&nbsp;  Stern also referenced Maher's plan to bring back his show \"Real Time\" without writers, a decision Maher subsequently reversed when there were signs of progress in negotiations with the writers strike.&nbsp; \"This is what happens when Bill doesn't have writers.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Douglas Miller said during a hearing in U.S. District Court that Deja Taylor can remain free on bond despite the failed drug tests because she has made efforts to improve. Taylor's son used her gun to shoot teacher Abby Zwerner in her Newport News classroom in January. The first-grade teacher was seriously wounded and has endured multiple surgeries. Taylor pleaded guilty in June to using marijuana while possessing a firearm. Authorities say she also lied about her drug use on a federal background check form when she bought the gun her son brought to school. A judge had set an Oct. 18 sentencing date and released Taylor on bond under the conditions that she submit to drug tests and receive addiction treatment. But Taylor has twice tested positive for marijuana and once for cocaine, federal prosecutors wrote in a filing with the court this month. She also missed two drug tests and two drug treatment sessions, they said.

Marijuana is legal in many U.S. states, including Virginia. But it's still a controlled substance under U.S. law, which generally prohibits gun possession by someone who has been convicted of a felony, been committed to a mental institution or illegally uses controlled substances, among other things. Authorities found marijuana at homes where Taylor was staying during searches that followed the shooting at Richneck Elementary School. Meanwhile, Taylor still faces sentencing for a state charge of felony child neglect, which was filed after the shooting. That sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 27.

The board consists of Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, Democratic state Attorney General Aaron Ford and the state's Supreme Court justices.

This past Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Fields threw two interceptions and was sacked six times.

BEARS DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR ALAN WILLIAMS RESIGNS TO FOCUS ON 'MY HEALTH AND MY FAMILY' Mahomes' words of encouragement came ahead of Fields' recent remarks about his recent \"robotic\" playing style. Fields suggested that the Bears coaching staff was at least partly responsible for him overthinking in games.  \"You know, could be coaching, I think,\" Fields said. \"At the end of the day, they are doing their job when they are giving me what to look at, but at the end of the day, I can't be thinking about that when the game comes. I prepare myself throughout the week, and then when the game comes, it's time to play free at that point \u2013 thinking less and playing more.\" The 24-year-old quarterback eventually walked back his comments, arguing that his remarks were taken out of context. \"I'm not blaming anything on the coaches. I'm never going to blame anything on the coaches,\" he said. \"I'm never going to blame anything on my teammates. Whatever happens in a game, I will take all the blame. I don't care.

McCormick, a former hedge fund executive, West Point graduate, Gulf War combat veteran and Treasury Department official in former President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, on Thursday launched his second straight campaign for the Senate.&nbsp; His announcement gives national and state Republicans a high-profile candidate with the ability to self finance. McCormick had been courted to run against longtime Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, Jr. \u2014 a race that could ultimately decide whether the GOP wins back the Senate majority in 2024. \"I have total faith and confidence in the people of Pennsylvania,\" McCormick said, but he stressed the need for leadership in Washington, D.C. \"That is why today, I am announcing my candidacy for the United States Senate,\" McCormick said as he launched his Senate bid at Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. BLUE TO RED: FOUR SENATE SEATS THE GOP AIMS TO FLIP TO WIN THE MAJORITY IN 2024  Asked why he was running again for the Senate, McCormick said in an interview with Fox News Digital that \"the motivation is the same in the sense that I really feel that the country\u2019s headed in the wrong direction.\" \"Whether it\u2019s the immigration crisis or the economy or record high inflation, whether it\u2019s the war on our domestic energy sector, I think the need to get great leaders into public life who can really make a difference and be independent and try to break the gridlock in Washington, which is failing us, is key,\" he said. CHECK OUT THE FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE BATTLE FOR THE SENATE And McCormick took aim at Casey, tying the three-term Democratic senator and son of a popular former Pennsylvania governor to President Biden, whose approval ratings remain well in negative territory. \"Bob Casey is an 18-year senator. He\u2019s been in politics 30 years and really hasn\u2019t accomplished very much at all. He\u2019s been a rubber-stamp for Joe Biden. He\u2019s voted for Joe Biden 98% of the time,\" McCormick said. \"If I can win this seat, I can really be a force for good in pushing back on Joe Biden\u2019s policies.\"  Casey, who served a decade as the state's auditor general and then treasurer before winning election to the Senate in 2006, is not expected to face any serious primary challenge for the Democratic nomination. FIRST ON FOX: SENATE REPUBLICANS BUILD WAR CHEST FOR EVENTUAL GOP NOMINEES IN CRUCIAL 2024 STATES McCormick may escape a crowded and combustible battle for the 2024 GOP Senate nomination similar to the one he faced last year. McCormick ended up losing the nomination by a razor-thin margin to celebrity doctor and cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who secured a primary victory thanks to a late endorsement from former President Donald Trump. Oz ended up losing the general election last November to now-Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.  Asked about lessons learned from his first campaign, McCormick noted in his Fox News interview that he has entered the race \"a lot earlier this time.\" \"When you lose by 900 votes, there\u2019s lots of lessons that you can learn. And so I\u2019ve tried to learn all the things that came out of that last race and despite losing it was a great experience,\" he emphasized. \"The most important thing is to get out there and be authentic.\" McCormick immediately won praise from the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the campaign arm of the Senate GOP. \"Dave McCormick has done a remarkable job of unifying the grassroots in Pennsylvania. A graduate of West Point, combat veteran and Pennsylvania job creator, Dave is exactly the type of candidate who can win both a primary and a general election in one of the most competitive states in the country. It\u2019s great news that Dave is stepping up to serve our country once again.\"&nbsp;NRSC chair Steve Daines wrote in a statement shared with Fox News.  A race between Casey and McCormick could end up being one of the most expensive and closely watched Senate contests in the country next year, as the Democrats defend their fragile 51-49 majority. Republicans need a net gain of either one or two seats in 2024 to win back the majority \u2014 depending on which party controls the White House after next year\u2019s presidential election.&nbsp; The math and the map favor the GOP, as the Democrats are defending 23 of the 34 seats up for grabs, including three in red states and a handful in key general election battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania. McCormick will likely once again come under attack \u2014 as both he and Oz did last year \u2014 over his residency. Oz was repeatedly criticized for relocating to Pennsylvania after living for decades in neighboring New Jersey. And McCormick, who grew up in northeast Pennsylvania and who is the son of the Keystone State's first state university system chancellor, was attacked for owning a house in an affluent part of Connecticut even while buying a home in Pittsburgh ahead of his 2022 Senate campaign. \"The real David McCormick is a mega-millionaire Connecticut hedge fund executive who is lying about living in Pennsylvania,\" the Pennsylvania Democrats charged in a release. McCormick told Fox News that he was born and raised in Pennsylvania, lived most of his life there and ran a business in the state. \"But like many Pennsylvanians, I\u2019m divorced and remarried. My youngest daughter is finishing high school in Connecticut \u2014 she lives with her mom \u2014 and I\u2019m going to go to Connecticut to see my daughter and to be a great dad,\" he said. Attacks on his ties to Connecticut are a distraction, McCormick said. Democrats are also blasting him over the combustible issue of abortion. Following the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade last year, abortion restrictions returned to individual states, making it a major election issue. Republicans have played defense as Democrats point to polling that shows most Americans favor at least some form of abortion access. \"Dave McCormick wants to ban abortions, even in cases of rape or incest,\"&nbsp;the Senate Majority PAC \u2014 the top super PAC backing Senate Democrats \u2014 said in a release hours before Thursday's campaign launch.  But McCormick told Fox News that \"my position hasn\u2019t changed. I\u2019m pro-life.\" And he reiterated that \"any limits on this [abortion] should be for exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. That\u2019s what I consistently said throughout the campaign [last year]. So that position hasn\u2019t changed.\" Asked about a 15-week federal ban that some Republicans in Congress and some GOP presidential candidates support, McCormick answered, \"I don\u2019t support a national abortion ban.\" \"This is also an issue where I think we have to show a lot of compassion and look for common ground. Certainly, we can \u2014 and most Pennsylvanians and most Americans agree we should have contraception and we have reasonable limits on late-term abortion. And that is a compassionate position and a consensus position. And that\u2019s the position I support,\" he emphasized. McCormick also claimed that \"Bob Casey can\u2019t name one limit on abortion he would support, even at eight or nine months. So, Bob Casey and the Democrats are supporting late-term abortions\u2026 I think that\u2019s how I\u2019ll talk about this on the campaign trail.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In last year's primary, Trump repeatedly criticized McCormick as a \"liberal Wall Street Republican,\" as he campaigned for Oz. But if Trump secures the GOP nomination, the former president and McCormick would both be at the top of the GOP ticket in Pennsylvania. \"It\u2019s publicly documented that we\u2019ve had our disagreements,\" McCormick said of his relationship with Trump. \"There\u2019s no doubt about that. We have different styles.\" \"But there\u2019s a lot of things I said in the last campaign that I say in this campaign about the polices of President Trump that I think were great for the country, great for America,\" he added. \"The country\u2019s going in a terrible direction since Biden has been in office and that\u2019s the case that I\u2019ll make, and I think many of the things that President Trump was advocating and put in place were taking us in the right direction.\" Fox News' James Levinson and Thomas Phippen contributed to this story Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T18:26:56-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Fentanyl-baby-dies_01.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "NYC police release photos of drugs found stashed in day care where 1-year-old died from fentanyl exposure", "content": "Police in New York City released photos of the drugs found under a floor trapdoor at a day care center in the Bronx, where a 1-year-old died of a fentanyl overdose last week.

Rather than transfer weapons to Ukraine, the prime minister said Poland was now arming itself with the most modern weapons due to fears of Russian aggression in the region. Morawiecki did not elaborate on how the two actions were connected. On Thursday, Polish government spokesman Piotr Mueller clarified with the Associated Press, saying Poland was only going to provide ammunition and armaments that were previously agreed upon. He added that there has been \"a series of absolutely unacceptable statements and diplomatic gestures\" from Ukraine on the matter. MOST GLOBAL LEADERS AT UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FIND COMMON TREND IN CONDEMNING RUSSIA INVASION OF UKRAINE  Poland supplied Ukraine with Leopard 2 tanks and Soviet-era MiG fighter jets, along with a wide range of weaponry. Yet, while the Polish citizens are largely in favor of supporting Ukraine out of fears their country would be vulnerable if Russia succeeded in Ukraine, there are growing concerns about the large numbers of refugees. With an election coming up Oct. 15, the right-leaning Confederation party has reiterated the lack of gratitude given to Poland by Ukraine for arming the neighboring country and taking in its refugees. RUSSIA ASSAILED BY ALBANIAN PM AFTER FAILED ATTEMPT TO PREVENT UKRAINE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY FROM SPEAKING AT US  Emotions have also been running high since Slovakia, Hungary and Poland announced a ban on Ukrainian grain imports to protect farmers, which went into effect last week. The dispute between Poland and Ukraine comes as the latter continues making slow progress against Russia. There are fears Poland\u2019s move to stop providing weapons to Ukraine will have wider ramifications as another winter of battle quickly approaches. Ukraine\u2019s leadership in Kyiv continues to ask for more advanced weapons, including longer range missiles, and U.S. Army Gen. Mark Milley, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said last week the need for increased weapons and equipment in Ukraine remains. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE OUR SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE  U.S. leaders are also looking for ways to continue providing weapons to Ukraine, though U.S. voters are growing tired of helping the foreign country. Michal Baranowski, a security and defense expert, told the AP that Poland gave most of what it could give earlier in the war, and with no plans for shipments of major equipment soon, he doesn\u2019t see a threat to Ukraine\u2019s capabilities in the near term.&nbsp; Still, he considers Morawiecki\u2019s comments troubling for Ukraine as it seeks to maintain Western support in the war unleashed by Russia. RUSSIAN TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM NORWAY BORDER IN DROP SINCE START OF UKRAINE WAR: OFFICIAL  \"The message is very bad, both for Poland\u2019s reputation but also because Poland has been one of the chief advocates of military aid to Ukraine,\" Baranowski said. \"Saying Poland will not be sending more weapons means that Poland can no longer play this role.\" He added that Poland is capable of both modernizing its military and continuing to help Ukraine. The ban on Ukrainian grain imports that was put in place last week to protect farmers from an abundance of Ukrainian grain in Poland, Hungary and Slovakia.

There are different causes of stroke, but the most common is a blockage of blood flow to part of the brain, which is called an ischemic stroke.&nbsp; Transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs \u2014 sometimes also called mini-strokes \u2014 are also ischemic attacks, but they only last for a few minutes before blood flow is restored.&nbsp; HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE A CONCERN WORLDWIDE, LEADING TO DEATH, STROKE, HEART ATTACK: HOW TO STOP A 'SILENT KILLER' That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re any less serious than a full-fledged stroke, though, noted Dr. Karishma Patwa, a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology, which provides cardiac testing and preventive treatment in New York. Patwa shared with Fox News Digital the most important things to know about identifying and preventing mini-strokes.&nbsp;  \"Every second that the brain goes without oxygen increases the likelihood of serious and permanent brain damage,\" Patwa said.&nbsp; \"Just like a stroke, a TIA deprives the brain of oxygen and should be treated with the same urgency.\" Causes of a mini-stroke There are several possible causes of a TIA.&nbsp; A clot could form in the brain itself, or a clot from another part of the body can break loose and make its way through the bloodstream until it becomes lodged in the brain, Patwa said.&nbsp; POPULAR ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER, ERYTHRITOL, COULD RAISE RISK OF HEART ATTACK AND STROKE: STUDY \"In order to best treat a TIA and prevent a future stroke, doctors will want to determine the exact cause of the TIA,\" the doctor said.&nbsp; \"The longer a person goes without examination, the less likely doctors will be able to determine the cause, leading to a diagnosis of cryptogenic TIA \u2014 which means TIA of unknown origin.\"  Once someone has had a mini-stroke, the risk of having another stroke event is between 5% and 10% within the first seven days, Patwa warned. \"This number actually goes up to about 15% in the first month after a TIA and up to 35% over the course of a patient\u2019s lifetime,\" she said. \"That\u2019s why early recognition and treatment of a TIA is extremely important \u2014 to prevent the more devastating complications of a large stroke.\" Symptoms of transient ischemic attack The symptoms of a TIA are the same as symptoms of stroke, Patwa noted.&nbsp; KETO DIETS COULD INCREASE RISK OF HEART ATTACK AND STROKE, SAYS NEW STUDY The symptoms can include:  \"Symptoms tend to appear suddenly and without any obvious cause,\" Patwa said.&nbsp; \"In the case of a TIA, the symptoms will last for less than a day, and often just a matter of minutes or even seconds, but it should still be treated as a medical emergency.\"  It\u2019s important to act quickly as soon as the symptoms begin, she said.

Don\u2019t wait to find out \u2014 call 911 immediately,\" she advised. Act \u2018FAST\u2019 The doctor recommends using the FAST acronym, a common tool for remembering symptoms and action steps when someone is suspected of having a stroke or TIA.  \"It\u2019s important to stress that someone who just experienced a TIA should not get behind the wheel of a car,\" Patwa also said.&nbsp;  \"Calling 911 and requesting an ambulance would be the best course of action, and in lieu of that, the closest responsible adult should drive the person to the emergency room,\" she added. Diagnosis and treatment For people who have had a TIA, prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment are the best route to an improved outlook, Patwa said. \"People who delay or refuse examination and treatment are much more likely to experience a stroke during the next 90 days.\" The symptoms may last for less than a day, and often just a matter of minutes or even seconds, but this should still be treated as a medical emergency. In most cases, a mini-stroke is diagnosed with a physical and neurological examination, medical history and imaging tests such as an MRI, CT scan or X-ray.&nbsp; \"Depending on what is found during diagnosis, a treatment plan could include medication, the use of stents, angioplasty or surgical procedures,\" said Patwa.&nbsp; Tips for preventing mini-strokes \"There are also steps a person can take to help prevent a TIA, or to help prevent a stroke after having a TIA,\" said Patwa. These preventative steps can include:   People who are at risk for stroke or coronary artery disease are at higher risk for transient ischemic attacks, Patwa said.

WHITE HOUSE REQUESTS SIX TIMES MORE SPENDING FOR UKRAINE THAN BORDER AND FENTANYL CRISIS  According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the package includes antitank weapons, air defense equipment, artillery rounds and other equipment to help meet Ukraine\u2019s needs on the battlefield against Russia. \"We're committed to help Ukraine build a force capable of ensuring Ukraine's long-term security, capable of deterring future threats against sovereignty, territorial integrity and freedom, which are underway now,\" Biden said. \"Because that's what this is all about \u2014 the future, the future of freedom. America can never, will never walk away from that.\"&nbsp; Before heading into the closed-door meeting with Biden, Zelenskyy said he was there to \"strengthen Ukraine\u2019s position to defend our children, our families, our homes, freedom and democracy in the world.\" GOP LEADERS RAIL AGAINST BIDEN'S $24 BILLION REQUEST TO AID UKRAINE, SAY IT 'DESERVES SCRUTINY'  \"It's good that our countries are really, truly allies,\" he said. Zelenskyy also met with Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, who also reaffirmed the country\u2019s \"unwavering support\" for Ukraine. During the meeting, Austin reportedly provided the Ukrainian president with an update on U.S. security assistance in order to help them meet urgent needs on the battlefield. FLASHBACK: VANCE DEMANDS BIDEN ADMIN TURN OVER 'FULL CROSSCUTTING' REPORT ON SECURITY ASSISTANCE PROVIDED TO UKRAINE  \"The secretary gave his personal commitment to work with our allies and partners to ensure they have what they need,\" Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said. The package marked the 47th time the Defense Department pulled equipment for Ukraine since August 2021. Last week, the White House confirmed the Biden administration had spent more than $100 billion on the war in Ukraine, through documents obtained by Fox News Digital. POLAND ANNOUNCES STOP TO SUPPLYING ARMS TO UKRAINE, SAYS MODERNIZING ITS OWN WEAPONS The information came as a response from the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget to Sen.

Fox News Digital obtained the OMB letter and spreadsheet responding to Vance more than 7 months later.

Thursday's speakers include leaders from China, Palestine, Greece, Congo, Denmark and Dominica. Many issues that have been addressed include climate change, Russia's war in Ukraine and economic cooperation.&nbsp; Here are some highlights of the leaders who spoke on Day 3: Serbia Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his country could \"not turn its back\" on traditional friends like Russia despite plans by his government to further strengthen ties with Western nations and seek European Union membership. \"I stand before you as the representative of a free and independent country, the Republic of Serbia, which is on its new accession path, but which at the same time is not ready to turn its back on traditional friendships it has been building for centuries,\" Vucic said.  Serbia has refused to join several other nations that have imposed sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; Vucic made his remarks days after talks brokered by the European Union between Serbia and Kosovo failed to make any progress. Both nations have stated their interest in joining the EU.&nbsp; Serbia and its former province of Kosovo have been at odds for decades. Their 1998-99 war left more than 10,000 people dead, mostly Kosovo Albanians. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 but Belgrade has refused to recognize it. Kosovo is not a U.N. member-state. Palestinians Mahmoud Abbas, president of Palestinian territories and the Palestinian National Authority, called for the international recognition of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital.&nbsp; He also called for Palestine to be admitted into the United Nations, like Israel.&nbsp; \"There are two states that the entire world is talking about: Israel and Palestine,\" Abbas said. \"But only Israel is recognized. Why not Palestine?\" \"What is the danger posed by the state of Palestine obtaining full membership of the United Nations?\" he added.&nbsp;  Abbas said the effects of the Nakba, known as the \"catastrophe\" in Arabic that refers to the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, are still felt today.&nbsp; Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for their hoped-for independent state. Some have accused Israel of enforcing an \"apartheid\" policy of Palestinian territories through a blockade of the Gaza Strip and security checkpoints.&nbsp; Abbas said the Israeli occupation of lands Palestinians want for their future state \"challenges more than a thousand resolutions, violates the principles of international law and international legitimacy, while racing to change the historical, geographical and demographic reality on the ground.\" The Israeli delegation walked out of the hall early in his address, when he spoke about Israel\u2019s practice of holding the remains of alleged Palestinian attackers. Danny Danon, Israel's permanent representative to the U.N., said Abbas claims to want peace but supports and pays \"for the terror of innocent Israeli citizens.\" \"While he claims to stand for justice he appropriates Israel\u2019s history, its legacy in the land, and even its capital Jerusalem. While he claims his side is the side of truth he reverts to lies and warmongering rhetoric,\" he said in a statement in response to Abbas' speech. \"And while the region is engaged in moving towards true peace and collaboration, he continues his annual deceitful tirade against Israel.&nbsp;  \"The Palestinians deserve better and deserve more. False and fabricated speeches at the UN no longer make the cut. Nor should they,\" Danon added. \"It\u2019s time he takes responsibility and provides his people with a brighter future instead of perpetuating his disinformation campaign and endless empty slogans.\" On Wednesday, Palestinian officials said Israeli military operations in the occupied West Bank and unrest in the Gaza Strip killed six Palestinians. The deadly violence between Israel and the Palestinians over the last year and a half has surged to levels unseen in the West Bank in some two decades. Israel has stepped up its raids on Palestinian areas and Palestinian attacks on Israelis have been mounting. \"The Israeli racist, right-wing government continues its attacks on our people through its army and its racist, terrorist settlers to continue to intimidate and kill out people to destroy homes and property,\" Abbas said.&nbsp; Abbas is deeply unpopular among Palestinians, many of whom view his Palestinian Authority as a corrupt pillar of the status quo. China Chinese Vice President Chinese Vice President Han Zheng raised alarms about upholding equity and justice and international peace, despite its aggression toward Taiwan and its own human rights record.&nbsp; \"Diversity of civilizations is an invaluable asset for human development,\" he said. \"Indeed, diversity is a defining feature of human civilization. Different countries and civilizations should prosper together by respecting each other, advance together by drawing on each other's strengths, and seek win-win outcomes by pursuing common ground.\" On Taiwan, which China claims as part of its territory, Zheng said \"there is but one China in the world.\" \"The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. And Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China's territory since ancient times.\"  Beijing recently sent over 150 warplanes toward Taiwan in an unprecedented military action that the island\u2019s government swiftly condemned as \"harassment.\" Despite its stance on Taiwan, Zheng said China is \"firm in upholding the legitimate rights and interests of developing countries and that it \"supports and respects their efforts to independently decide on the development paths in keeping with their national conditions.\" Zheng also said nations should advance human rights through cooperation and oppose double standards, in particular, the use of human rights and democracy as a political tool to interfere in the affairs of other countries.&nbsp; The remarks stand in contrast to Beijing's detention of Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the western region of Xinjiang. A U.N. report released last year said the Chinese government has committed \"serious human rights violations\" in its treatment of the Muslim groups.&nbsp; Greece Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told the assembly of world leaders Thursday that climate change remains one of the most important challenges, citing devastating wildfires, floods and rising temperatures across Greece.&nbsp; \"The science is clear,\" he said. \"Unprecedented temperatures fueled by global warming are creating the conditions that drive these catastrophic events.\" \"This is no longer a crisis of the poorest, or global south,\" he added.&nbsp; Mitsotakis also spoke about his country's mass migration crisis. Over the past decade, Greece has received thousands of migrants risking their lives on the Mediterranean Sea to reach its shores, he said.&nbsp;  He said the root causes of migration need to be addressed in the countries of origin, along with investments in several areas to prevent the flow of mass migration and breaking the business model of human trafficking and criminal groups.&nbsp; Many migrants that reach Greece come from Africa.&nbsp; \"When it comes to migration policy, Greece's policy is tough but fair,\" he said.&nbsp; He noted that Greece is focused on enhancing legal migration.&nbsp; \"We must address the negative, political, socioeconomic and climate trends at source,\" he said. \"In the countries of origin but also in the countries of transit.\" On Wednesday, Italian President Giorgia Meloni also spoke about the mass migration to her country and the criminal gangs that transport them in often dangerous conditions.&nbsp;  \"In this chaos that produces tens of millions of people potentially in search of better living conditions are infiltrated criminal networks that profit from desperation to collect easy billions,\" she said. \"They are the traffickers of human beings.\" France French Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna said Europe overcame centuries of conflict through cooperation and trust.&nbsp; \"Nothing can morally or legally ever justify the invasion of a neighboring state to attempt to annex territory through underhanded maneuvers and marginalize the population,\" Colonna said of Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.&nbsp; \"If we allow our common principles to be trampled there, they'll be trampled everywhere,\" she added.&nbsp;  She added that France supports the fight against radical Islamists. She called out the Taliban for the repression of women in Afghanistan. She said the Taliban has placed \"violence against women at the heart of its political identity.\" French President Emmanuel Macron skipped this year's top-level meeting event amid a reported busy diplomatic schedule.&nbsp;CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&nbsp; The Associated Press contributed to this report.&nbsp;", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T15:10:24-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Untitled-design-1074.png?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Illinois burglary suspect released after stealing $68K in items on heels of state\u2019s new cash bail elimination", "content": "A burglary suspect in a Chicago suburb was released from jail Thursday, after allegedly stealing tens of thousands of dollars in items from a high-end boutique.

If you've got a feeling there's something you lack. Just switch your pronouns and refuse to switch them back. Yeah. No. All right, all right, all right. President Zelenskyy was just in New York for the U.N. General Assembly to plead for more help for Ukraine, meaning more money, more weapons, and fewer visits from Sean Penn. Unfortunately, he didn't get to meet with President Biden. Too bad he was looking forward to almost shaking his hand, but Zelenskyy missed a lot more than high-fiving the zombie in chief. He also didn't know that the spokesperson for his own military was this American person. Yeah, just an all-American girl. One who makes Leah Thomas look like Reese Witherspoon. RUSSIA ASSAILED BY ALBANIAN PM AFTER FAILED ATTEMPT TO PREVENT UKRAINE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY FROM SPEAKING AT US SARAH ASHTON-CIRILLO: Next week, the teeth of the Russian devils will gnash ever harder and their rabid mouths will foam in uncontrollable frenzy as the world will see a favorite Kremlin propagandist pay for their crimes and this puppet of Putin is only the first. Russia's war criminal propagandists will all be hunted down and justice will be served.  Sorry lady, Justice would be served if someone bought you a better wig. I also apologize to everyone on the West Coast watching this at dinnertime, especially if you're having sausage. So Zelenskyy didn't know who Sarah Ashton-Cirillo was, a deeply strange transgender spokesperson. Good for him. I usually don't find out the damsel is a dude until we're back at the hotel. But now the Ukrainian military has suspended Sarah for being a massive psycho on social media. Viewers might also remember this one. SARAH ASHTON-CIRILLO: If you look at Putin's mouth, you'll notice that blood drips from it. He's a vampire carrying out genocide against both Ukrainians and Russians alike. Vlad Putin bathes in the blood of innocent children and enjoys it and this is why the dictator of the Russian Federation must be deposed. Doesn't it seem hypocritical for a trans person to be insulting vampires? After all, they come from trans-ylvania. But Sarah seems nice. If by nice you mean bat **** crazy. So this isn't really about Sarah being trans at all. It's that she's insane and an American spokesperson for a foreign war. I don't get it. And yeah, Putin is a bad guy. True. He makes Ivan the Terrible seem like Ivan the Not so Bad Once You Get to Know Him. And if you ever meet Putin, my advice is don't stand near any open windows. That breeze you feel is an oligarch flying by from the floor above you. Vlad has had more enemies whacked than anyone, although there is a close second. But apparently Zelenskyy had no idea who this was and claims he never approved Ashton-Cirillo's hiring, but then there are a lot of things Zelenskyy doesn't know, like how to find green shirts at Old Navy that fit. But it's as if that gets him off the hook and by hook, I mean Sarah's penis. I know, but Zelenskyy not knowing about this person, who could have predicted that? RUSSIAN TROOPS WITHDRAW FROM NORWAY BORDER IN DROP SINCE START OF UKRAINE WAR: OFFICIAL  TOM SHILLUE: It doesn't make any sense. I don't know who they are, but has anyone asked Zelenskyy about, you know [if] he's comfortable with this person. They should. They should put that to him. Mmmm, Tom Shillue, his slogan should be he's as smart as he is white. So why does he have H.R. department finally involved? It's not because poor Sarah requested time off for a prostate exam and a pap smear. It's because this nutjob with a nut sack is going after U.S. citizens. Last week, Senator J.D. Vance sent a letter to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken asking who the hell this person is and why a U.S. citizen is acting as a spokesperson for a foreign government and why he, she, and, or, it keeps going online and saying crazy things. I mean, who does Sarah think she is, Joy Behar? So, Vance wants to know what we want to know. Who is this clown? Why is an American acting as a spokesperson for the Ukrainian military? And who's paying for all this? And why does he keep giving me flashbacks of my eighth grade lunch lady? And now I clutch my privates when I hear the words tater tots. This cuckoo clock responded to the senator's inquiry with yet another deeply odd video. SARAH ASHTON-CIRILLO: While in Ukraine we are fighting for global liberty and the ideology of victory too many in Moscow and across the world are still caught up in focusing on the tired trope of gender chaos. Sorry, champ. This statement about gender chaos might carry more weight if it wasn't coming from a guy named Sarah. I mean, how can Ukraine not win with this person involved? Look, it's just that after 250-years of the U.S. Military, you're the first spokesperson to tuck in their balls before getting dressed. But kudos for stealing Jen Psaki's hair. So how did Sarah get this far in the military, our military? The oddball holds the rank of junior sergeant, which means someone promoted this. I guess being a protected class opens every door and not just the ones to the girls' locker room, but does Sarah want to finish by stating anything unequivocally? GREG GUTFELD: WE'RE SEEING MORE EXAMPLES OF PEOPLE USING THE BANNER OF TRANS TO DO INSANE THINGS  SARAH ASHTON-CIRILLO: I'll finish by stating unequivocally that I only answer to three groups of people. My Ukrainian commanders, the Ukrainian people and the American taxpayer. Well, he left out the girls at the Macy's makeup counter who helped him hide his 5 o'clock shadow. But he says he answers to American taxpayers. Well, okay, as an American taxpayer, I demand an answer, do you get yeast infections or jock itch? But also what the hell is going on over there? Yes, they're fighting a war. I should know I'm paying for it. But they had no idea this charmer was going online and saying all this bizarre **** on their behalf.

It may be years until the costs and timelines of drug discovery decrease measurably, particularly because some estimates are that more than 20% of the cost is from clinical trials which are necessarily manual.&nbsp;  And I worry that once the shine wears off of AI, interest from those outside of the lab will dissipate. Investors, governments and journalists will play key roles in funding, regulating and publicizing how AI is changing drug discovery.&nbsp; So, I\u2019m laying out my case for paying attention \u2014 and staying optimistic \u2014 as the life sciences industry does the hard work to make the promise of AI a reality.&nbsp; 1. The industry is (finally) set up to succeed  Long seen as a laggard among industries, life sciences is finally catching up in the race to digitally transform.&nbsp; Pharma companies have access to scalable and cost-effective infrastructure and tooling for managing massive amounts of data, particularly as they adopt a more efficient approach to building databases for electronic data capture (EDC). The traditional approach for this sort of database build takes around 12 to 16 weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Perhaps just as crucially, the life sciences ecosystem is finally aligned on the importance of digitization. In February 2020, digital leaders surveyed by McKinsey reported that their biggest hurdle to convincing their companies to transform was a \"lack of leadership support.\"&nbsp; But today, after the shock of the global coronavirus pandemic, that hurdle barely rates.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Barriers remain \u2014 and they\u2019re getting bigger  Strategic alignment and executive leadership are only the first steps. Pharma still faces significant challenges in making AI useful \u2014 namely, a tsunami of data and complex new treatment modalities.&nbsp; Advanced research techniques produce ever-larger amounts of information. Genomics research is expected to generate between twp and 40 exabytes of data within the next decade. (An exabyte is one billion gigabytes, so that\u2019s about 8.3 million iPhones\u2019 (128 GB size) worth of storage.) And the velocity of the growth of that data is only increasing.&nbsp; This detailed data offers tremendous long-term value for drug development, though it poses short-term challenges. Pharma companies must learn to harness it for AI to be effective in the lab. It\u2019s not just a matter of buying the right technology \u2014 organizations also need to ensure their data governance practices.&nbsp;  This includes designing data collection protocols with future reuse in mind. The R&amp;D process for new treatment modalities, such as monoclonal antibodies, mRNA vaccines, and gene editing is costlier and riskier than for traditional drugs. &nbsp; CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Life sciences companies must be able to use the knowledge their researchers gain from abandoned targets and clinical failures to make ongoing development of new treatments cost-effective.&nbsp; 3. Small Wins Add Up to Transformative Change  All of this work, from upgrading technology to analyzing the results of failed clinical trials, is slow and arduous because of the manual work involved. Frankly, it\u2019s going to be a grind.&nbsp; Long seen as a laggard among industries, life sciences is finally catching up in the race to digitally transform.  But that\u2019s what makes progress meaningful. By investing in the platforms and processes that enable the practical use of AI in the lab, Pharma companies are building the foundations for a future in which scientists develop treatments quickly and cost-effectively. Each new drug candidate, whether it succeeds in clinical trials or not, represents a step toward better health and quality of life for people with both common or rare diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Keep in mind that the introduction of ChatGPT wasn\u2019t a Cambrian moment either. The idea of large language models dates back to the 1960s. Computer scientists and chip designers worked quietly and diligently for decades to make the release of ChatGPT possible. Along the way, they delivered advances in data storage and processing that have transformed how we live and work.&nbsp; Pharma\u2019s march toward successful application of AI will be punctuated with the same small wins that add up to transformative change.

Among other lessons, the story of Narcissus indicates that human vanity flowered even without human technology. Ovid added, \"All that is lovely in himself he loves, and in his witless way he wants himself.\" \u2018Dynamic time\u2019 Robert Cornelius was born in Philadelphia on March 1, 1809, to Christian and Sarah Cornelius. His father was a Dutch immigrant from Amsterdam; his mother\u2019s birthplace is apparently unknown.&nbsp; There are also conflicting reports of her maiden name, either Soder or McGowan.&nbsp;  Cornelius was, it appears, instinctively curious with the ambition, he would later prove, of an innovator and entrepreneur. \"After receiving an ordinary education, early in life he entered in the business of his father \u2026 in the manufacture of lamps,\" the American Journal of Photography wrote in an 1892 biography.&nbsp; \"The 1830s were a dynamic time in photographic experimentation.\" \u2013 Conservation Center for Art & Historic Artifacts The City of Brotherly Love was bursting with intellectual energy and the dynamism of the new nation it helped forge only a few decades earlier.&nbsp; Benjamin Franklin already put Philadelphia on the global map as a center of curiosity and innovation in the years before the American Revolution, with discoveries that made him the darling of London science and society.&nbsp; \"The 1830s were a dynamic time in photographic experimentation,\" reports the Conservation Center for Art &amp; Historic Artifacts in Philadelphia.&nbsp;  \"On either side of the Atlantic, scientists and amateur hobbyists alike traded techniques and&nbsp;guarded discoveries as they sought to capture the world around them in a still image.\" The breakthrough moment came from France in the summer of 1839. Artist Louis Daguerre perfected a process to capture images on sheets of silver-plated copper. MEET THE AMERICAN WHO WAS REVERED AS THE \u2018PATRON SAINT\u2019 UNTIL HE WAS CANCELED: LENNI LENAPE CHIEF TAMMANY \"The publication of Daguerre\u2019s discovery in August 1839 sent a shockwave across the burgeoning photography community,\" added the Conservation Center.&nbsp; It took only a few weeks for a curious American with access to silver and copper at the family business to turn the camera on himself.  \"In October 1839, in the backyard behind his family\u2019s store, Cornelius took what is today heralded as the first 'selfie\" \u2014 the world\u2019s first photographic self-portrait, in which a hazy, off-center Cornelius looks down lens,\" the Conservation Center reports. Selfie invades our most intimate spaces The vanity and curiosity that inspired Cornelius to instinctively capture his own likeness has spawned a exponential proliferation of ourselves as art form in the nearly 200 years that followed.&nbsp; The desire has transcended the bounds of earth. Astronaut Michael Collins took the first space selfie aboard the Gemini 10 mission in July 1966; a future crewmate on the Apollo 11 first moon-landing mission one-upped Collins a few months later.  Buzz Aldrin snapped the first spacewalk selfie in November during the Gemini 12 mission.&nbsp; The advent of smartphones in the 21st century elevated the ancient instinct to stare at ourselves in the water into an instant capability and constant temptation. The cellphone selfie had its coming-of-age party at the 2014 Academy Awards. \"The (Ellen DeGeneres/Bradley Cooper) star-packed shot tops Twitter's list of most-tweeted entertainment moments with nearly 255,000 tweets per minute.\"  Bradley Cooper grabbed Ellen DeGeneres' phone and snapped a celebrity-all star pic that included Brad Pitt, Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence. The shot lit up global social media and was widely proclaimed the most famous selfie in history.  \"Eight months later, the star-packed shot tops Twitter's list of most-tweeted entertainment moments with nearly 255,000 tweets per minute,\" The Hollywood Reporter shared in December 2014. \"With more than 3.3 million retweets, it was also the most retweeted&nbsp;post on the social network this year.\" WHY ARE MEN OBSESSED WITH THE ROMAN EMPIRE? HISTORY EXPERT SAYS IT'S A \u2018VERY AMERICAN THING\u2019 Even the hopelessly untrendy now knew the phrase for the image first captured by Cornelius 175 years earlier. Selfies are now a visual art form unto themselves with entire social-media platforms, such as Snapchat, and even their own subgenres.&nbsp;  The celebrity selfie, the mirror selfie and the \"bedfie\" \u2014 the selfie while lying in bed \u2014 have all inspired pop-culture and social media trends. Cornelius-admirer Coelho is at the forefront of one of the newest.&nbsp; Her Instagram is devoted to the emerging art of the bathroom selfie, so prominent these days that she says it is inspiring American restaurants and hotels to invest in camera-ready restrooms.&nbsp; \"They call it taking a selfie \u2026 I call it taking a lonely.\" \u2014 Comedian Sebastian Maniscalco  She cites Gift Horse in Providence, Rhode Island, Sugarfish in Miami, Florida and the Beekman Hotel in New York City among them. The images, many submitted by followers, pair personal fashion with the latest in loo decor.&nbsp; Her posts are pretty, confident and vulnerable all at once. They are also a sign that the temptation for people to show themselves off has invaded even the most intimate corners of daily life.  Humans snap nearly 100 million smartphone selfies every day, according to various industry estimates.&nbsp; The obsession with \"self\" has inspired a cultural backlash.&nbsp; \"Something's wrong in the country. Where do people get the time? \u2026 Taking a photo of yourself!?\" comedian Sebastian Maniscalco barks with acidic condemnation in an outrageous viral video clip from his stand-up act.&nbsp; \"American millennials spend about 38 hours annually snapping self-portraits \u2026 and 33 hours attending social events.\" \u2014 Bureau of Labor Statistics \"They call it taking a selfie. I can\u2019t even say the word without sweating. I can\u2019t stand the word. I call it taking a lonely.\"&nbsp; Selfies may be starting to take a social toll, too.&nbsp;  The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this year that American millennials (ages 18-34) spend about 38 hours annually snapping self-portraits.&nbsp; That\u2019s more time they spend walking (22 hours), managing personal finances (11 hours) or, perhaps most damningly, attending social events (33 hours).&nbsp; Interest in ourselves appears to come at the expense of interest in others, proving the ancient warnings of Narcissus were wisdom more than mythology. \u2018Vanity and self-preservation\u2019 Robert Cornelius died in Philadelphia on Aug. 10, 1893. He was 84 years old.&nbsp; He\u2019s buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery, a National Historic Landmark overlooking the Schuylkill River.&nbsp;  Cornelius \"in connection with Dr. Paul Beck Goddard \u2026 opened the first studio for photographic (daguerreotype) portraiture in the world in the northeast corner of Eighth Street and Lodge Alley (now Jayne Street),\" the American Journal of Photography wrote in its 1892 biography. \"He is also credited with publishing the first photographic advertisement in the history of art, which appeared in the Philadelphia Public Ledger.\" Cornelius, according to various reports, appears to have popularized the new art form of photography by shooting Philadelphia's movers and shakers in his studio. His time in photography was only short-lived. He closed the studio in 1843.&nbsp; He went on to become a leading innovator in the power and light industry.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER His impact on photography has long outlived his few years at the forefront of its evolution.&nbsp; His artistic curiosity in himself presaged a movement that's consumed global culture. The ease at which smartphones and social media boost the ease and temptation of self-admiration is changing human behavior.&nbsp; \"In the age of social media, the term narcissism keeps coming up in our feeds more and more frequently,\" archaeologist Antonis Chaliakopoulos wrote in 2021 for TheCollector.com, a Canadian-based community of humanities scholars. \"Narcissus\u2019 myth can remind us that obsessive self-love is not something new and certainly not healthy.\"  Coelho, the modern-day selfie-trendsetter, believes Cornelius deserves adulation for advancing the deeply embedded human desire to capture our own image - and perhaps achieve some sort of immortality curated by ourselves. &nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think the first photographic selfie relates to that vanity and self-preservation,\" she said.&nbsp; \"The selfie allows the taker to capture themselves when they look and feel their best and control the outcome of the photo before putting it out in the public eye.\" To read more stories in this unique \"Meet the American Who\u2026\" series from Fox News Digital, click here.&nbsp;", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T04:00:21-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Getty_DawnLyn_Split.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "\u2018My Three Sons\u2019 actress Dawn Lyn making miraculous recovery after brain surgery and coma: \u2018gives doctors hope\u2019", "content": "Dawn Lyn has \"vastly improved\" following a lengthy health battle that has racked up mounting medical bills for her family.

She was moved to a different facility where she continues to receive therapy daily. Reese told the outlet that insurance covered the initial surgery and has paid more than $2 million, but that the couple is responsible for the remaining balance. He launched a GoFundMe in June of this year.  \"For a while, she wasn\u2019t speaking at all,\" said Livingston. \"And then about three months later when I called, she would try and answer some questions, which I felt was a big improvement.

He brings her all this stuff to her. When people think you don\u2019t care, that can really affect their recovery. But seeing all the outpouring of love and seeing all the people that want to help goes a long way.\" While Lyn is not \"out of the woods yet,\" Livingston described his pal as \"a fighter.\"  \"The fact that she can speak is a big step,\" he said. \"And it gives doctors hope that this individual being treated can recover. And if you keep on fighting, as she has been doing, there can be better days ahead.\" \"This can happen to anyone,\" he warned. \"One day you can feel totally fine, and the next day, your health takes an unexpected turn, no matter how much you try to prepare for anything.

Ten Thousand migrants \u2026\" Doocy said before being cut off again. \"Peter, I tried to answer the question, and you stopped me,\" Jean-Pierre said before turning to the other reporter once again. \"Let's go.\" The back and forth between the two trended on social media as several people called out Jean-Pierre\u2019s lack of a response to nearly record levels of border crossings.

In heavily redacted memos obtained by Americans for Prosperity Foundation (AFPF) and reviewed exclusively by Fox New Digital, the agency appeared to circulate ahead of the launch of the disinformation board justification that DHS has regulatory or statutory authority in the \"the MDM Space\" \u2013 short for \"misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation. But because DHS withheld all the substance in these memos that AFPF requested via FOIA and then by a lawsuit, the group says DHS is effectively relying on secret authorities for its work in the \"MDM Space.\" \"If DHS believes it has the authority to police people\u2019s online speech, it should be open with the public about what those authorities are,\" AFPF Director of Investigations Kevin Schmidt told Fox News Digital. BIDEN DOJ TO FIGHT COURT ORDER THAT BLOCKED FEDS FROM COLLUDING WITH BIG TECH TO CENSOR SPEECH  \"The idea that any agency with such vast political power believes it has the authority to determine what ideas count as good or true upsets the delicate balance of power established by our founding fathers,\" he said. One memo is partially withheld under FOIA Exemption 7(E), which protects \"techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations.\"  The use of the exemption, AFPF says, is troubling because it suggests DHS is either overstating its authority in the \"MDM Space\" or it's abusing FOIA exemptions to avoid transparency. GOP LAWMAKER AIMS TO CUT US TAXPAYER DOLLARS FROM UNITED NATIONS 'CENSORSHIP' PROGRAM  \"Our Constitution was designed to protect people\u2019s liberties from overreaching authorities. But the documents we\u2019ve uncovered suggest that DHS believes it has overreaching authorities to regulate speech under the guise of countering misinformation even without a Disinformation Governance Board,\" Schmidt said. According to the documents obtained by AFPF, the Disinformation Governance Board also began working on misinformation related to \"irregular migration\" and \"Ukraine\" before it was disbanded. One memo produced from the FOIA request is dated Feb. 22, 2022, and titled \"Ukraine MDM Playbook,\" but the content of that memo is redacted in the document produced to AFPF.  Ken Cuccinelli, former deputy secretary of Homeland Security during the Trump administration, told Fox News Digital in a statement that \"DHS does not have censorship authority.\" \"Making up a new government acronym \u2013 \u2018MDM\u2019 \u2013 does not change that legal fact,\" he said.

This critical work continues today across several DHS components, consistent with the law, and in a manner that is transparent and upholds the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of the American people,\" the spokesperson said. In August 2022, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas terminated plans for the \"disinformation board\" after mounting backlash. But in November 2022, leaked documents published by The Intercept revealed that while&nbsp;DHS disbanded the disinformation board, the agency was still working to combat disinformation on a range of topics, including COVID-19, vaccines, racial issues, the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and Ukraine aid. According to a draft copy of its Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, which is DHS\u2019 capstone strategy document, the agency intends to target disinformation on topics such as \"the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine,\"&nbsp;The Intercept reported.

Aubrey Trail, a 56-year-old, was convicted and sentenced to death for Loofe's murder. Prosecutors said he strangled Loofe with an electrical cord and cut her body into 14 pieces, which he then dumped in various ditches along the sides of rural roads in Nebraska. Trail's girlfriend, now 29, matched with Loofe on Tinder and solicited both the victim and Trail for group sex.

NEBRASKA COUPLE CHARGED WITH BRUTALLY MURDERING, DISMEMBERING TINDER DATE The suspect also befriended the nurse in her pursuit of information for her book. They thought of themselves as \"true crime buffs,\" according to court documents obtained by KETV.  Trail eventually began communicating with the nurse, who told the killer that she was having relationship troubles with her husband. Trail allegedly manipulated the nurse, telling her that he hired a hitman to kill her husband, and the job could only be stopped if she paid him $25,000. He also apparently convinced the nurse to smuggle contraband into prison for him, including a phone, chewing tobacco and a firearm, the Lincoln Journal-Star reported.

The nurse quit her job in 2021.   \"Trail also mentioned his intent to have a firearm smuggled into the prison,\" an investigator wrote in the affidavit, according to the Lincoln Journal-Star.

Harmon's family is suing school's principal Bradley Layfield and assistant principal Matthew Jones over an alleged meme that replaced the student's face with Janet Jackson's, an apparent reference to an infamous 2004 Super Bowl incident in which Justin Timberlake exposed the singer's breast during the halftime show. According to the lawsuit, filed this month in Delaware State Court, Harmon was involved in a May incident in which she witnessed two students, one boy and one girl, arguing in the hallway. When Harmon confronted the apparently irate girl involved in the altercation, the other student \"attacked\" Harmon, the suit alleges. A school employee then stepped in and pulled Harmon away from the altercation, which allegedly caused part of her clothes to come apart and expose one of her breasts. MICHIGAN SCHOOL DISTRICT FACES LAWSUIT AFTER FORCING STUDENTS TO REMOVE 'LET'S GO BRANDON' SWEATSHIRTS  The two administrators then shared the footage with other staff members without blurring the student's breast and used the footage to create the meme and show other school employees, according to the lawsuit. At least six other people had access to the image of the student's breast, the lawsuit claims. Harmon's attorney, Emeka Igwe, told Fox News Digital the complaint \"alleges invasion of privacy, civil conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\" Tosha White, Harmon's mother, told NBC News word allegedly started spreading throughout the community that the meme existed a few days after the incident.&nbsp; \"I didn\u2019t have any proof that it was my daughter, but all of the facts started to add up,\" White said. White said she was called by the district's assistant superintendent eight days later and asked to schedule a meeting but was never told what the meeting would be about. Instead, White hired an attorney. By that time, both Layfield and Jones had been placed on administrative leave, White and her attorney told NBC News. Both are still listed as employees on the school's website.  Representatives for Sussex Central High School referred a Fox News request for comment to the Indian River School District. A spokesperson for Indian River School District told Fox News Digital that the district \"does not comment on pending litigation.\" Both the school and the district are named in the lawsuit. Neither Jones nor Layfield immediately responded to a Fox News request for comment. Layfield's attorney, Thomas S. Neuberger, told Fox News Digital his client had \"no involvement with\" creating the meme that was allegedly circulated, instead arguing that it was Jones who acted on his own to create the image without Layfield's knowledge. MICHIGAN MIDDLE SCHOOL HIDES STUDENT'S TRANSGENDER STATUS FROM PARENTS According to Neuberger, Layfield showed the footage of the fight to multiple people, including state police officers who were at the school. However, Layfield did not notice Harmon's breast was exposed in the footage, the attorney argued, noting that the camera was positioned quite a distance from where the incident took place. Instead, Layfield was following the protocol of investigating the altercation, Neuberger said, and it was only later that the alleged image was created by Jones. \"This looks to be a shakedown designed to force money from the school district,\" Neuberger told Fox News Digital.  Neuberger said Layfield has long been a respected member of the community and school district and has no previous incidents or trouble, adding the ordeal has caused his client distress and damaged his reputation.

The Delaware State Board told Fox News Digital that it \"does not comment on the existence of or details of specific investigations,\" while the Delaware Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment. A spokesperson for the Delaware State Police confirmed an investigation into a potential crime at Sussex Central High School \"in collaboration with the Delaware Department of Justice\" but did not provide details of the investigation.  \"Unfortunately, we cannot provide an estimated timeline for the investigation as investigations can often be unpredictable, and it's not uncommon for unexpected developments to arise,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Delaware State Police cannot share any further information at this time.

Philip Paxson, a 47-year-old Navy veteran, had been driving his Jeep on Sept. 30 after the birthday party \u2014 which was camp-themed after inclement weather forced them to cancel their camping plans that weekend \u2014 when Google allegedly led him to a bridge that has been inoperative since heavy flooding in July 2013 destroyed it, the complaint states. \"It's been almost a year since Phil's death, and it still doesn't seem real,\" Phil Paxson\u2019s wife, Alicia Paxson, said during a Wednesday press conference. \"I just struggle every day to understand how something so unimaginable and horrific could be allowed to happen. I still don't have the answer. To tell my daughters I don't have the answers to the question: \u2018Why is daddy gone and why isn't he coming back?\u2019 I don't know how to explain this life-shattering tragedy that could have been so easily prevented.\" Alicia added that it is \"impossible to comprehend how those responsible for Google Maps GPS misdirection and the neglected, unbarricaded, collapsed bridge could have just such disregard and negligence for human life.\" NORTH CAROLINA MAN DEAD AFTER FOLLOWING GPS TO DESTROYED BRIDGE THAT DROPPED INTO WATER  \"It could have been anyone,\" she said. Alicia is also suing Hickory businessman James Tarlton and the companies Tarde LLC and Hinckley Gauvain LLC as the owners of the collapsed&nbsp;bridge, which is located at 24th Street Place NE in Hickory and otherwise known as the Snow Creek Bridge. EXTENSIVE FLOODING DAMAGE PRODS NEW ENGLAND STATES TO REEVALUATE DAMS, CULVERTS The developers allegedly sold their property in the area but \"never turned the roads over to the North Carolina Department of Transportation,\" according to an investigation conducted by attorneys Robert Zimmerman, Larry Bendesky and Michael Benz.  The owners \"refused to properly maintain the bridge, leaving it in a horrendously dangerous state of disrepair for years\" and \"refused to place reasonable and proper barricades in front of the hazard,\" the complaint states. NORTH CAROLINA CITY DENIES PERMIT FOR CHRISTMAS PARADE FOLLOWING DEATH OF 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL LAST YEAR A 2014 article titled, \"BRIDGE TO NOWHERE: No resolution in sight for neighborhood's gaping hole,\" published in the Hickory Record stated that the bridge was \"still in disrepair\" eight months after flooding had destroyed it in 2013. Nothing had changed in nine years at the time of Paxson\u2019s death and 10 years as of publication.  Over the years, locals put concrete barricades and cones around the collapsed bridge in an effort to deter drivers, but that evening on Sept. 30, 2022, Paxson could not see the barricades and drove off the 20-foot drop that the Snow Creek Bridge once covered. On the night of his death, Alicia drove to their friend\u2019s house early before their daughter\u2019s birthday party to help set up. Phil followed soon after with both of his daughters but stayed later to help clean up while his wife and children drove home.  The Paxson family had recently moved to Hickory from Florida after Phil was promoted, so he was unfamiliar with the area at the time of his death, the lawsuit states. NC APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS LAW GIVING ADULTS WITH CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE CLAIMS MORE TIME TO SEEK DAMAGES His house was about a 10-minute drive from the home where his daughter\u2019s birthday party was being hosted, and he input his home address into Google Maps on the evening of Sept. 30 to get back, according to the lawsuit.  \"We have the deepest sympathies for the Paxson family,\" Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Our goal is to provide accurate routing information in Maps and we are reviewing this lawsuit.\" Zimmerman noted during Wednesday\u2019s press conference that multiple Google Maps users have submitted complaints to Google about the collapsed bridge over the years. In fact, on Sept. 22, 2022, just days before Phil\u2019s death, a Google Maps user alerted the app to the collapsed bridge by using its \"suggest an edit\" feature. Google responded by saying, \"Thanks for your report near 24th St. Pl. SE,\" in acknowledgment of the user\u2019s note, according to the complaint.  Still, the route was apparently never corrected to go around the bridge. \"Those responsible for our roadways need to know that inaction has consequences,\" he said. \"We believe that when someone develops a neighborhood, it doesn't end when they sell the house. We allege that there needs to be a responsible maintenance plan in place if the roads are not going to be turned over to the new North Carolina Department of Transportation.\" Zimmerman added that \"when something as dangerous as an unguarded 20-foot cliff is in the middle of a neighborhood \u2026 it must be repaired, and it must be guarded until those repairs are made.\"  There is \"no good reason\" the collapsed bridge and 20-foot canyon drop should have been \"allowed to exist for nine years and 10 years to this day,\" he said.

U.S. News &amp; World Report made headlines with its alteration to its famed college and universities rankings that came out Monday, which put a greater emphasis on \"social mobility\" and advancement for poorer students, and discounted past metrics like average class size and alumni giving.&nbsp; \"More than 50% of an institution\u2019s rank now comprises varying outcome measures related to success in enrolling and graduating students from all backgrounds with manageable debt and post-graduate success. In addition, five factors were removed: class size, faculty with terminal degrees, alumni giving, high school class standing and the proportion of graduates who borrow federal loans,\" the company announced with its latest rankings. The usual contenders were at the top like Princeton, MIT, Harvard and Stanford, but some private institutions like the University of Chicago, Vanderbilt, Wake Forest and Tulane saw moderate to dramatic falls from last year. Meanwhile, some public institutions saw huge rises. While many academics sniff at the rankings as a crude way to measure educational value, the New York Times noted many institutions nevertheless use them as marketing tools. COLLEGE RANKINGS SYSTEM CHANGE EMPHASIZING \u2018SOCIAL MOBILITY\u2019 RANKLES SOME PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES Marketing expert Marcus Collins told FOX News Digital that \"social mobility,\" a mere euphemism for economic mobility as he put it, is \"essentially the value exchange of college.\" \"That\u2019s what the promise of higher education, the value proposition\u2014if you will. It\u2019s not just knowledge acquisition; education is supposed to be the means by which people are able to elevate themselves in society. Get a good job and have a chance at the American dream. This furthers discourse around the validity of higher education. If people are going to colleges and universities, accruing tons of debt, but not elevating their place in the world, what is the value of said education? It certainly isn\u2019t worth the small fortune that people pay to get it,\" he told FOX News Digital.&nbsp;  If people don't get access to a better life from their degree, was it worth it, he asks? \"This thought experiment begs the argument that what people are looking for should be a factor in how the school is evaluated/ranked,\" he said. STUDENT DEBT CRISIS IS A BIG SCHOOL PROBLEM. THIS IS AMERICA'S SMALL SCHOOL MOMENT Other experts shrugged at the uproar over rankings. \"Rankings are someone\u2019s opinion filtered through math,\" Akil Bello, director of advocacy and advancement for the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, told USA TODAY this week. \"That\u2019s all it is.\" Anna Ivey, a college admissions consultant and former admissions dean at the University of Chicago Law School, told USA TODAY that the rankings aren't relevant to most students anyway. After all, the schools that dominate discussion at the top of the lists only select a tiny proportion of applicants, while the vast majority of college hopefuls will attend larger, and more affordable, public institutions. \"Treat it for what it is,\" she said of the rankings. \"No less, no more.\" U.S. News &amp; World Report didn't respond to a request for comment.

Aaron Bean, R-Fla., said a recent hearing on alleged Chinese Communist Party (CCP) funding in K-12 institutions should serve as a \"wake-up call\" for Americans. Tuesday's hearing, entitled, \"Academic Freedom Under Attack: Loosening the CCP's Grip on America's Classrooms,\" explored alleged CCP influence in American schools through Confucius Classrooms, whose stated purpose is to promote Chinese language and culture. They have been described by the National Association of Scholars as \"a smaller version\" of the Confucius Institutes.&nbsp; Republicans on the committee and some witnesses claimed Confucius Classrooms are more interested in promoting communism and whitewashing contentious issues like Taiwan and Tiananmen Square. Committee members also suggested Confucius Classrooms were a national security threat because a few are reportedly located near U.S. military bases. \"This blatant attempt to inject foreign ideologies into our schools undermines the fundamental purpose of American education,\" subcommittee chair for Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education Bean said in his opening remarks. \"It goes without saying, we should be teaching American values in American schools.\"  PARENTS DEFENDING EDUCATION LEADERS SAYS CHINESE COMMUNIST INFLUENCE ON AMERICAN SCHOOLS IS \u2018DEEPLY CONCERNING\u2019 Nicole Neily, the president of Parents Defending Education (PDE), a grassroots organization dedicated to fighting indoctrination in the classroom, testified they have uncovered evidence linking CCP-sponsored financial entities to American K-12 schools. A recent PDE investigation found that several districts around the country have been taking money from the People's Republic of China over the past several years. PDE's FOIA findings, which are not yet complete, can be seen here.&nbsp; \"America needed a wake-up call,\" Bean told FOX News Digital Tuesday. \"We talked about the wake-up call coming in the form of a Chinese spy balloon. But on an education level, we heard from a panelist today talk about the infiltration of the Communist Chinese Party into the American classroom under the guise of what\u2019s called these Confucius Institutes, where they try to bring their culture and their language into the classroom. Sometimes giving money to the school districts.\" Bean called Confucius Classrooms \"a front for Chinese propaganda.\" \"In postsecondary education, the CCP exerts soft power on the American education system through cultural exchange outposts known as Confucius Institutes,\" the House Education and Workforce Committee added in a press release. \"The K-12 arms of this propaganda machine, called Confucius Classrooms, were under the microscope today for their potential malignant influence.\" UNIVERSITY TO CUT TIES WITH CHINESE CONFUCIUS INSTITUTE AFTER GOP SCRUTINY ON $17M DOD GRANT Bean pushed back on the narrative that hearings of this nature only fuel \"anti-Asian hate.\"&nbsp; \"Two words: not true,\" Bean told FOX Digital. \"Not true at all.\" \"The recurring theme of this hearing is, there are no sentiments against Asian Americans,\" he continued. \"It's always the Chinese government. It's the government who's oppressing 1.4 billion people. That is the root cause of this problem. So that's where the committee focused its efforts to make sure that this is the Communist Chinese Party is who's to blame, who's leading this problem, and who we need to address the concerns to.\"  Rep. Michelle Steel, R-Calif., similarly said opposing Confucius Classrooms has \"nothing to do with racism.\" One witness, Gisela Perez Kusakawa, who serves as the executive director for the Asian American Scholar Forum, said she regretted that Asian Americans appeared to have become \"collateral damage\" and treated as \"convenient scapegoats\" and \"perpetual foreigners.\" She asked the committee to engage in \"genuine dialogue\" and to \"consider how we speak about China can lead to ramifications for Asian Americans.\" \"Therefore it becomes essential that we do not allow U.S. tensions with a foreign, Asian country to translate into an overreaction by the federal government or within our education system that leads to negative impacts for the Asian American community,\" she said in her opening testimony. 'ALARMING EVIDENCE' LINKS CHINA'S COMMUNIST PARTY TO AMERICAN K-12 SCHOOLS, ANTI-INDOCTRINATION GROUP CLAIMS  Kusakawa added that it was important for students to have exposure to different cultures and to become bilingual.&nbsp; \"We are not accusing folks of being racist,\" she later said. \"But merely asking for caution and really exercising critical and careful approach. Understanding the unique experiences that Asian Americans have, especially currently as U.S.-China tensions have peaked.\"&nbsp; Ryan Walters, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction, testified on Tuesday that schools in his state are now required to report any donations or influence coming from the Chinese Communist Party.

According to Gallup, 50% of U.S. adults aged 55 and older say they are \"extremely proud\" to be American, 40% of those aged 35 to 54 and 18% of 18 to 34-year-olds say the same.&nbsp; \"I think it's a profound lack of perspective that is leading young Americans to be less proud of their country,\" Di Martino told FOX News Digital. Di Martino recalled a moment that highlighted the contrast in perspectives between immigrants like himself and some young Americans. \"EXTREME PRIDE\" IN AMERICA WANES TO NEAR RECORD-LOW NUMBER AHEAD OF FOURTH OF JULY  \"I was sitting down in an American politics class with an American student next to me, and she told me that first day, I don't remember how this came up, but she said that she wishes she hadn't been born in the United States and I just could not believe it,\" Di Martino said. \"I just told her, you know, if there was a citizenship exchange program, I would exchange with you right now.\" The lack of \"extreme pride\" by some Americans, Di Martino said, stems from a loss of perspective. Americans today may be unfamiliar with the reality of living under the oppressive regimes of the Soviet Union, Mao's China or Venezuela, he argued.&nbsp; \"We need to remind young generation's that even though the Soviet Union doesn't exist, there are still hundreds of millions of people living under oppression, totalitarianism,\" he said. Di Martino also perceives the decline in U.S. patriotism to be partly attributed to education.&nbsp; \"Now, it's actually a subject of controversy, patriotism. Should you be patriotic? Is America a good nation or a bad nation?,\" he said. \"Public schools should be unequivocally promoting that America is a good nation because it is.\" He added, \"America is not a bad nation, America is not a racist nation, America is a good nation and that doesn't mean it's perfect, but relative to the rest of the world it's much better.\" Additionally, Di Martino suggested that schools need to do more to promote and celebrate the United States.&nbsp; PARENTS OUTRAGED AFTER CALIFORNIA SCHOOL VOTES TO FORBID BANNERS OTHER THAN AMERICAN, STATE FLAG  Di Martino criticized the reluctance of some schools to promote patriotism, emphasizing that acknowledging America as a \"good nation\" doesn't negate its flaws, but places them in context. He added, \"Parents need to play a role in their kids' education, and they can, you know, protect their children from going woke or from going anti-American.\" Moreover, while economic factors like inflation can create pessimism, Di Martino cautioned against attributing declining pride on such factors. Instead, deeply ingrained perceptions play a bigger role, he said, but Di Martino warned against American leaders further exacerbating the issue, as was the case when U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said, \"We need to dismantle White supremacy,\" in her 2021 address. \"The narrative needs to shift. We need to promote positive, inspirational leadership,\" he added.  Di Martino believes that the American dream is still alive but requires a change in attitude. \"A patriotic, happy nation will invariably be a richer and better one,\" he said.

WATCH:   WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE California struggled with an exodus of residents fleeing the state following the COVID-19 pandemic and many chose to settle down in Texas, according to a report published in June by Storage Cafe, an online storage space marketplace. Between 2012 and 2021, the number of Americans moving from California to Texas nearly doubled, with around 111,000 Californians who left for the Lone Star state that year, the report found.&nbsp; The Balek family packed their bags and moved from Camarillo, Calif., to Rockwall, Texas in April 2021 joining the large exodus of residents from the Golden State. They cited skyrocketing housing costs and living expenses, school curriculum battles and frustration over strict COVID-19 restrictions that led to their decision.&nbsp; \"We were trying to figure out how to buy a house that was big enough for our big family,\" Jennifer said. \"It was impossible, even with two good-paying jobs.\"  \"The financial aspect was a really big deal for us, but I mean COVID was really our tipping point,\" she continued. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS STEP UP SEARCH FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES OUTSIDE THE STATE, STUDY FINDS Some Californians that remained are torn about staying. Four out of 10 residents said they were considering moving out of state, a Strategies 360 poll published in June found.&nbsp; Over half of the respondents said California was too expensive to live in when asked which best described their reason for wanting to leave, according to the poll. More than a quarter \u2013 27% \u2013 said California's policies and laws didn't reflect their personal political views and 10% cited an unspecified reason for considering the move.&nbsp;  \"It was a good 20% less cost-wise to live here,\" Jennifer said about moving to Texas from California. \"Most of it is cost of living.

On Thursday, the average gas price was around $5.80 in California, over two dollars more than Texas's average at $3.40 per gallon, according to AAA.&nbsp;  \"I'm looking for land with the thought that someday if our kids want to come build on that land, they can build on the land,\" Chuck said. \"Who can own land in California? The mega-rich.\" But Chuck also said politics played a large role in their move.&nbsp; \"During COVID I felt wholeheartedly that government was absolutely the problem,\" Chuck said. \"And so when we came to Texas even to visit, to house search, there was no mask mandate. There was no government telling us how everything needed to be done.\" NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA LOST MORE TAX INCOME THAN EVERY OTHER STATE AS PEOPLE FLED LIBERAL ENCLAVES The Baleks also saw politics creeping into their kids' education and felt their parental rights were being ignored in California's school system.&nbsp;  \"The agendas being pushed in the schools did not fall in line with how we wanted to raise our children,\" Chuck said. \"The schools shouldn't be pushing an agenda behind our backs and even with that, we're not allowed to have an opinion at the school board meeting.\" Debates over&nbsp;what topics are appropriate for classroom discussions, such as critical race theory and gender identity, have become flashpoints in schools nationwide over recent years. Parents have increasingly spoken out at school board meetings to voice concerns and advocate for a say in their kids' education.&nbsp; In California, for example, a judge blocked a school district policy earlier this month that required parents be informed if their kid identified as transgender, causing outrage among parental rights advocates.

She said speaking out allows her to shine a spotlight on a topic that many feel shame to openly discuss.   \"I have anxiety and depression, so doing this calendar was absolutely terrifying for me,\" the Iowa resident admitted. \"But also, at the same time \u2026 the purpose for this calendar is far bigger than me. And it will hopefully outlive me in the fact that we will continue to support our veterans after I\u2019m ever in the calendar.\"  Lamp said growing up she was inspired by her father\u2019s love for the military. The patriarch often wore a faded Army green jacket, went through pairs of black combat boots and restored military jeeps. LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

Lamp enlisted in the USAF in 2003. Her father died before he could see her serve. \"Cancer sucks,\" she said.  According to Lamp, the many women she witnessed joining the USAF inspired her to enlist. She became a satellite operator with the 3rd Space Operations Squadron at Schriever Air Force Base (now Space Force Base). Afterward, she earned a scholarship to complete her bachelor\u2019s degree in physics at Washington State University in 2009 and was then commissioned as a second lieutenant.&nbsp; Afterward, she was stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, followed by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, from 2012 to 2014. She earned her master's degree in applied physics, focusing on optics.  After Ohio, Lamp was stationed in Los Angeles. She was deployed to Afghanistan in 2016 to Kabul as a NATO contracting officer.

Even though it was a support mission, there were still attacks going on, whether they were \u2026 people shooting up the PTDS [persistent threat detection system] or trying to throw mortars over the wall.  \"It was still threatening,\" she continued. \"But I think the biggest thing that stood out for me was the plight of the Afghan people. I got a harsh reminder of that when the withdrawal happened \u2026 [in] Afghanistan. All the difficulties, just living the horrible reality over there, hits home again.\" When Lamp returned to civilian life, she faced depression and anxiety and struggled to find her place in the world.  \"The military is a huge family,\" she explained. \"It\u2019s a huge support network where all of you have similar experiences and are serving for the same purpose. And then when you\u2019re released back into the civilian world, you\u2019re on your own. You\u2019re alone to redefine it. It\u2019s like a second life.\"  Lamp said she was still serving when she met Elise through a mutual friend and fellow model. Elise launched Pin-Ups for Vets in 2006 after seeing news articles about underfunded health care programs for veterans. She was horrified by the stories of veterans who had been seemingly forgotten by loved ones, never receiving visitors. And there were those struggling from injuries sustained in Iraq. PIN-UPS FOR VETS MODEL JANAE SERGIO RECALLS SURVIVING HOMELESSNESS BEFORE JOINING THE NAVY: \u2018BE YOUR OWN HERO\u2019 Elise, whose late grandfather served in the Army for four years during WWII, wanted to make a difference.

If there\u2019s a veterans' kitchen, maybe you can donate some food items. If other veteran assistance programs exist in your area \u2026 ask what they need. You can even do a quick Google search in your area, and it\u2019s probably a lot easier too if you\u2019re going to help locally.  \"If you know someone who\u2019s in the military and transitioning, it doesn\u2019t hurt to reach out and say, \u2018I\u2019m here for you if you need anything,\u2019\" Lamp continued. \"Just check in every once in a while.

Lamp hopes &nbsp;when people see her photos in the calendar, they\u2019ll think of the word \"resilience.\" \"Being in the military as a woman, you\u2019re already a minority,\" she said. \"Being a woman in science, you\u2019re already a minority.

The young team, led by veteran third baseman Jose Ramirez and others, was a gritty squad that went 92-70.&nbsp;  While they eventually fell to Sabathia's Yankees in the American League Division Series, that performance in the franchise's first year as the Guardians ushered in the new era perfectly in Kaulig's eyes.&nbsp; \"I think a key to them last year was they were good,\" he explained. \"If they would\u2019ve changed the name to Guardians and had a bad season, I think you would\u2019ve lost a lot of fans. You would\u2019ve lost a lot of Indians fans. You would\u2019ve lost a lot of Cleveland Fans.&nbsp; \"But they didn\u2019t. I think they\u2019ve gained a bunch of fans by performing well.\" Today, teams like the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs and MLB's Atlanta Braves continue to face vitriol and pressure to change.&nbsp; And while some may feel Indians is still appropriate \u2014 a petition exists to \"Bring Back the Cleveland Indians Name\" online with over 1,500 signatures \u2014 Kaulig feels the Guardians are on the right path to success as the franchise looks ahead to more winning with a new name.

The Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Forest Service and the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents thousands of federal wildland firefighters, have warned for months that the federal government will run out of money to pay firefighters by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. Up to half of the entire workforce is expected to quit as a result of the \"pay cliff.\" \"The temporary pay increases for firefighters authorized under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will continue through the end of the fiscal year,\" Jaelith Hall-Rivera, the USDA's deputy chief for state and private forestry, wrote in a memo on June 20. \"We are doing everything we can to inform and educate members of Congress on the potential consequences of the pay cliff.\" Hall-Rivera testified, during a Senate hearing weeks earlier, that approximately \"30 percent to 50 percent of our firefighting workforce would leave the service and go elsewhere\" if legislation wasn't passed by the end of September earmarking funding for firefighter wages. DEMOCRATS' CLIMATE CHANGE BLAME GAME FOR HAWAII FIRE CONFRONTED BY REALITY AFTER MAUI IDENTIFIES CAUSE  Under the Wildfire Risk Reduction provision of the trillion-dollar Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Congress passed and President Biden signed in late 2021, the USDA was appropriated $3.4 billion to combat wildfires through September 2026.&nbsp; The multiyear funding arrangement included $600 million \u2014 $480 million for USDA and $120 million for the Interior Department \u2014 for wildland firefighters. The Biden administration ultimately used the funding to award firefighters raises worth up to $20,000 or 50%. The most recent data shows, as of last week, roughly $109 million remains in the Forest Service's wildfire risk reduction account established by the 2021 infrastructure law. That funding would allow the agency to pay firefighters for at least an additional month past its emergency \"pay cliff\" deadline of Sept. 30. ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE BLOCKING FOREST MANAGEMENT METHODS SAVING ICONIC SEQUOIAS AMID YOSEMITE WILDFIRE \"As of September 13, the Forest Service has at most enough funding to cover the cost of only two pay periods after the end of the Fiscal Year,\" a USDA spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"The pay cliff issue remains imminent without Congressional action.\"&nbsp; \"Put simply, without a permanent pay fix that creates certainty for our federal firefighters at both the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior, we will continue to lose these employees to other, higher paying jobs which leave communities, wildlife and public safety in jeopardy,\" the statement continued. \"Rather than focus on red herrings, Congress should instead get to work to protect the wildland firefighters we depend on to keep communities safe.\"  National Federation of Federal Employees Executive Director Steve Lenkart confirmed that the Forest Services had enough money to cover wages through Nov. 4, not Sept. 30. He said the extra month was a result of the fire season being \"little slower than last year.\" \"I think everyone is on the same page now,\" Lenkart told Fox News Digital. \"As we say in the biz, \u2018sh-t happens.\u2019\" According to USDA's data, at the end of the month, $24 million will be left for wages, $25 million will remain for mental health and wellness services, and $30 million will be left for backpay and hazard pay.&nbsp; INTENTIONAL FIRES HELPED SAVE YOSEMITE SEQUOIAS FROM WILDFIRE, ECOLOGIST SAYS When asked whether $55 million left remaining for wellness services and backpay could be tapped to cover wages, the USDA spokesperson said such a solution would sacrifice key resources. \"This would be denying our hardworking firefighters funding and resources that they deserve,\" the spokesperson said. \"The best solution is for Congress to take action.\"  However, Republican lawmakers have pushed back on the USDA's claims of a looming \"pay cliff,\" questioning whether the agency could, in fact, use leftover funds for firefighter wages. One GOP aide close to negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that, when it was asked, the USDA presented documents that were created less than three hours earlier. \"USDA has continually failed to answer congress' questions related to this funding and have failed to communicate clearly with the brave men and women on the front lines of these fires,\" the GOP aide told Fox News Digital.&nbsp; \"Interestingly, while USDA claims the outstanding funds are to be spent on mental health programs and human resource cases, when asked for details, documents received from USDA revealed no programs existed and the meta data revealed the documents were created just hours before submission to Congress,\" the aide added. \"It doesn't seem like USDA is taking this crisis or addressing the root cause seriously.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, a group of bipartisan lawmakers led by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., introduced the Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act in July that would permanently keep wages at levels under the 2021 infrastructure law.&nbsp; Those lawmakers then sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last week, demanding an immediate floor vote on the bill.", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T05:00:10-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Barak-tank-row.png?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Israel\u2019s new multimillion-dollar AI tank provides total battlefield vision: \u2018A new era\u2019", "content": "Israel unveiled the \"Barak\" tank as its newest artificial intelligence (AI)-powered military advancement, promising a \"new era\" in combat capabilities. \"The Barak tank is very innovative \u2014 it takes our maneuvering capabilities to another level, and it is a clear expression of our technological capabilities,\" Israeli Minister of Defense (IMOD) Yoav Gallant said of the tank, whose name translates to \"lightning.\" \"I would like to express my appreciation to the engineers of the Tank and APC Administration, the Israeli Ground Forces and all those involved in the professional process,\" he added.

Gen.

The tank\u2019s unveiling occurred some two decades after the Merkava\u2019s introduction, which officials believe the Barak will replace by the end of 2025 in the 401st Brigade.&nbsp; Officials also plan to produce \"dozens\" of tanks each year to further update the force. \"In the last year, the 401st Armored Brigade dealt with the absorption and assimilation of the Barak Tank into the brigade,\" said Col.

I think at the end of the day, schools will be obsolete. The teachers, the administrators, the unions, the whole bureaucracy.\" Palm Beach Atlantic University professor of communication and Supper Honors Program director Dr. Tom St. Antoine argued, however, the technology presents educators with a \"really good opportunity.\" IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITY UNVEILS PLAN TO TEACH STUDENTS WITH AI CHATBOTS THIS FALL: \u2018EVOLUTION\u2019 OF \u2018TRADITION\u2019 \"In colleges and universities, we've been sort of obsessed with A.I. technology because for a lot of people, it poses little challenges like plagiarism and it sort of devalues the ability to do original work. So it's something that gets talked about a lot on universities,\" St. Antoine told FOX News Digital. \"In the midst of all that sort of hand-wringing, I've seen it as a really good opportunity. I welcome those conversations because I think it sort of puts a spotlight on the fact that universities have been promising to give students something that really is outside our strength. It's outside what a true university education can offer.\"  Similarly to the rise of the internet, artificial intelligence has already made its way into the education system from ChatGPT to even teaching college courses at some of the nation's most prestigious universities.&nbsp; ChatGPT is a generative AI chatbot capable of having conversations with humans, suggesting edits to computer programming code, writing songs, poems, movie scripts and more. In education, ChatGPT has been a controversial tool some teachers perceive as a threat to traditional pedagogy. IN EDUCATION, \u2018AI IS INEVITABLE,\u2019 AND STUDENTS WHO DON'T USE IT WILL \u2018BE AT A DISADVANTAGE\u2019: AI FOUNDER Many students have been utilizing the technology for schoolwork and assignments, including essay writing. AI has also proven to be a useful tool in helping students with their college applications.&nbsp; Schiff argues the potential transformation of education from human teaching to A.I. is a \"wonderful\" thing, noting economic and social benefits.&nbsp; \"People's property taxes could go down dramatically if we don't need those public schools. But also, it's going to be a great leveling field because, right now, kids who are in affluent communities who are born to wealthier parents, as you know, even if they're in the public schools, they're in a much better public school than some kid born in the inner city. AI is going to level the playing field for everybody,\" Schiff said. \"Everybody is going to have access to the same level of teaching at virtually no cost through AI. And so people will be able to educate themselves from home with using artificial intelligence more efficiently and better and faster than the current system.\"  Teachers and schools across the country are taking action to address the rise of new technology, including the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), one of the nations's largest teachers' unions. For example, New York City Public Schools banned ChatGPT in classrooms earlier this year only to reverse course after weighing educational benefits the technology provides. The AFT published a resolution earlier this summer that called for \"advanced technologies to be developed and employed ethically. It urges governments to implement strict regulations protecting privacy, security and well-being. And it calls for social media and AI technologies that adhere to principles of equity, fair access and social accountability.\" Among several matters of concern, the resolution noted \"AFT leaders in higher education expressed concern that fiscal pressures may push public colleges and universities toward even more online learning. And public employees who work in federal, state and local public service fear their jobs may be increasingly outsourced to chatbots and other robots.\" EDUCATORS HAVE SAID USING CHATGPT IS CHEATING, BUT NOW THEY ARE USING AI TO WRITE SYLLABI AND EXAMS: PROFESSOR Even the founder of an A.I. company conceded the technology's impact of education is \"inevitable.\" \"AI in education is as inevitable as the internet or a search engine, which also people were skeptical about in the beginning,\" said Julia Dixon, a former tutor who created ES.AI, a generative AI tool for college applications. \"Students who never use AI and those kinds of resources that can really up-level the work that they're doing are going to be at a disadvantage.\" \"The sooner that students can get familiar with this tech, the more ahead they'll be in the rest of the education and professional world,\" she continued.&nbsp;  Echoing Schiff's sentiment, digital technology entrepreneur David Espindola told FOX News Digital in April that AI developments would help America's \"broken\" education system. Schiff also argued the educational opportunities presented by A.I. means individuals will have the opportunity to be \"better educated\" and may be able to bypass higher education. As concerns over the cost of tuition and worries over student loans often plague college attendees, Schiff argues A.I. learning is a huge \"positive.\" \"Fewer people will need to go to college and even college level courses can be done [with] A.I which means that there'll be no more student loans. People won't be 20, 23 years old, starting out in life with a huge mortgage and no house,\" he explained. EXPERTS SAY AI COULD RADICALLY CHANGE \u2018BROKEN\u2019 US EDUCATION SYSTEM FOR THE BETTER: \u2018READY TO BE DISRUPTED\u2019 St. Antoine, who works on a college campus, said while it's \"certainly possible\" A.I. could have an impact on enrollment, there are a \"myriad\" of other issues causing more people to reconsider higher education.&nbsp; \"It may be hard to isolate A.I. as kind of a one cause for declining college enrollments,\" he said. \"There may be a headwind in a number of other places. But again, I go back to the opportunity. That's not a threat. That's an opportunity to give us a chance to say preparing for a job or whatever other things we offer in university life isn't the only reason to go to college.\" \"A.I. can write a book for you, but it can't read a book for you\u2026 A.I. can do things for us, but it can't be things for us.\" - Dr. Tom St. Antoine While St. Antoine agreed with the positives outlined by Schiff, he pushed back on the notion education is simply about gathering and sharing information.&nbsp; \"These are really good insights and very good positives, but they also just sort of rest on the assumption that education is, again, just the transfer of information from one source to another. And if education is more than that, if it's sort of the nurture of the mind, the nurture of souls in the context of a relationship between students and between teacher and student, then those strengths and those arguments might become a little bit more irrelevant.\"  Though St. Antoine argues A.I. will have a place in education to help with the more practical side of education, i.e. \"gathering and sharing\" knowledge, he asserts that the formative part of education - nurturing the mind and helping with soft skills - will not be something A.I. can replace.&nbsp; \"A.I. can write a book for you, but it can't read a book for you. And so that's when education really happens, when we're exposed to exciting, challenging new ideas. We have the experience of studying them and then maybe modifying our own worldview to accommodate those new ideas. And it's that side of education that I think remains.\"\"A.I. can do things for us, but it can't be things for us. And if education is this process of learning to be something, this process of becoming and not just a process of doing that, I think it helps us to understand more clearly what is and what isn't being threatened by these products,\" St. Antoine concluded. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPEconomist Schiff's stance, however, considers the money-saving and reallocation that A.I. can achieve for American communities. \"We want to relieve communities of the burden of having to pay teachers. We all want our kids educated. We don't want to pay teachers. But right now, in order to educate our kids, we have to pay the teachers. But if we can educate our kids without having to pay the teachers, that's great. We have more money left over to do other things,\" Schiff reasoned.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a White House official only said the American Climate Corps (ACC), which Biden created via executive action Wednesday, would tap into existing streams of revenue. But the official declined to share the exact price tag of the program previously pegged by Democrats at between $10 billion and $30 billion. \"The American Climate Corps leverages existing programs and existing authorities across agencies, who will work together to implement the ACC,\" the White House official said. According to the White House, the ACC will mobilize \"a new, diverse generation\" of more than 20,000 Americans who will be trained and put to work on conservation, clean energy and environmental justice projects. The ultimate goal of the program, which largely mimics New Deal-era initiatives, is to pave the way for paid members of the corps to find jobs in the public and private sector. BERNIE SANDERS LEADS LAWMAKERS DEMANDING DOJ PROSECUTE FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES FOR CLIMATE CHANGE  Biden's executive action came after progressive lawmakers, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and climate activist organizations repeatedly called for such a work program to combat global warming.

The pricey program has failed to receive congressional support. For example, Biden's American Jobs Plan released in March 2021 earmarked $10 billion for a climate corps, the description of which closely mirrored the American Climate Corps announced Wednesday.  And the Build Back Better Act, which the House passed in late 2021 with a Democratic majority but stalled in the Senate, proposed to appropriate $30 billion for \"national service and workforce development in support of climate resilience and mitigation,\" the provision that would have created a climate corps. That provision was stripped from the Inflation Reduction Act, the legislation that replaced Build Back Better. HILLARY CLINTON BLAMES 'MAGA REPUBLICANS' FOR MAKING IT HOT OUTSIDE \"As is standard practice for the Biden administration, yesterday's climate corps proposal is another executive overreach forced onto the American taxpayer,\" House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., told Fox News Digital. \"Instead of addressing rampant inflation, skyrocketing energy prices or the crisis at the border, the Biden administration is more focused on pleasing radical environmental groups. \"Meanwhile, American families are struggling to keep the lights on or put food on their tables,\" Westerman added. \"While Republicans are working to pass solutions like the Lower Energy Costs Act, this administration is turning its back on average Americans and creating expensive programs without congressional approval just to appease the furthest left wing of their donor base.\"  The ACC proposal also received criticism from experts who said it was unnecessary, expensive and could get in the way of existing private and public sector conservation efforts.

Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., is warning that Border Patrol may be undercounting the number of illegal immigrant \"gotaways\" at the southern border as the U.S. continues to face a crushing migrant crisis. Biggs, the co-chair of the House Border Security Caucus, said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, obtained first by Fox News Digital, that while official statistics indicate that there have been around 675,000 \"gotaways\" this fiscal year, the number could be higher. The term \"gotaways\" refers to illegal immigrants who evade Border Patrol but who are detected on another form of surveillance. Biggs warned that under current practice, agents report daily on the numbers they believe got by them, but this can be inaccurately reported.

Current Border Patrol Jason Owens has made similar remarks about how the agency has increased detection capability. &nbsp; The letter comes as numbers have again skyrocketed at the southern border, including a surge of thousands into Eagle Pass, Texas, this week. Sources told Fox on Thursday that there were more than 10,000 encounters across the border in a 24-hour period. Multiple Border Patrol sectors have been left overwhelmed, with some sectors resorting to releasing detained migrants to the streets. Sources have also said that numbers for August appear to be on track to be around 230,000, a significant increase from the more than 180,000 encountered in July and 144,000 encountered in June.

The&nbsp;Democrat hopeful&nbsp;joined a cadre of liberal activists who used the pandemic to make extreme requests on public officials. According to a letter on Justice Teams Network, which seeks to eradicate all forms of \"State violence\" and \"criminal acts\" against prisoners, the far-left coalition sought to implement dozens of radical initiatives. In May 2020, Simon&nbsp;signed the letter alongside&nbsp;the likes of former Black Lives Matter leader Patrisse Cullors, which they had sent to elected and appointed officials with regard to concerns about how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted \"Black people inequitably in Oakland and what the long-term consequences will be.\" It contained a link to its \"Black New Deal,\" which Simon had also co-signed, and stated that they remained committed to implementing those demands. The deal includes its most extensive list of orders, including \"reparations for Black people,\" which it categorizes as a long-term demand. ILHAN OMAR CALLS ISRAEL LOBBY AIPAC A 'RIGHT-WING' PAC FUNDED BY 'DARK MONEY'  To the group, reparations include a&nbsp;laundry list of items&nbsp;such as \"debt forgiveness, free education, free healthcare, enforcement of CA Slavery Era Insurance Registry &amp; similar local slavery era disclosure ordinances including mandatory reporting, imposition of maximum fines &amp; penalties, mandatory fund contribution from companies that have disclosed already, and distribution of funds to Black-led organizations serving Black populations.\" \"Possibly even expand law to include profiteers from the housing/financial crisis and carceral systems,\" the group wrote. The Black New Deal also pushed for the likes of removing police from schools and ending cash bail. During the pandemic, specifically, the group wanted the \"decarceration\" of prisons, \"ceasing police use of pandemic to conduct raids\" and no National Guard or military enforcement, among other radical requests. The Community Ready Corps and The Anti Police-Terror Project convened \"a range of Black leaders\" to develop the letter and its vast list of far-left demands.

Yet, it shows signs, after four years of marked improvements under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, of sinking into a full-blown catastrophe. &nbsp; Americans are desperate for accountability, and it may be time for Congress to employ the full weight of constitutional action against the president and appropriate officials if they will not uphold their oaths of office.&nbsp; LEAKED IMAGES SHOW BIDEN ADMIN'S PLANNED ICE ID CARD FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Last month, it was revealed that the FBI has been attempting to track down members of a group of illegal migrants who were allowed to enter the country after requesting asylum. It was not until Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials cleared these migrants (as is standard protocol for thousands of illegal aliens every day), that the FBI discovered the connection of an ISIS-affiliated smuggler who was facilitating these travelers\u2019 journey into the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;  The FBI and other officials will tell everyone that this situation is proof that the system works, and that the federal government will eventually find out who is a potential threat to this nation and track them down in the homeland. &nbsp; However, Americans who have been witnessing the breakdown of law and order at the southern border know differently. The case of this ISIS-affiliated smuggler is likely one of countless security nightmares at the border taking place every month \u2014 and the Biden administration is allowing the chaos and lawlessness to get worse, not better.&nbsp; We know from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the border patrol has encountered 146 suspected terrorists between ports of entry at the southern border just this fiscal year alone. This number is up from 98 in Fiscal Year 2022 and 15 in Fiscal Year 2021. &nbsp; There are also thousands of aliens who are arrested by border officials every year who have criminal records from previous stays in our country. Many of these criminals have committed very serious offenses in America, and yet they migrate back to our communities.&nbsp;  Lest the government again inform you that the apprehension of these suspected terrorists and criminals is Exhibit A of the system working to perfection, the number of arrests from border officials is always a fraction of the total number of individuals crossing the border.&nbsp; Since Biden took the oath of office on January 20, 2021, more than 1.5 million illegal aliens (otherwise referred to as \u2018gotaways\u2019) have escaped apprehension by law enforcement, making their way into communities across the country. &nbsp; Their identities and motives are largely unknown to everyone in our government. There could very well be terrorists, gang members and hardened criminals setting up shop in a neighborhood near you \u2014 all due to the Biden administration\u2019s refusal to enforce the laws and secure the border.&nbsp; With facts such as these, the debate over securing our border should be largely settled. All elected officials, regardless of their party affiliation, should desire to protect their constituents and come together to do what is right for our nation\u2019s future. &nbsp; We know from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that the border patrol has encountered 146 suspected terrorists between ports of entry at the southern border just this fiscal year alone. This number is up from 98 in Fiscal Year 2022 and 15 in Fiscal Year 2021.  Sadly, this has not been the United States\u2019 reality for several years. Instead of upholding their oaths of office, politicians have decided to promote radical open-borders agendas that give complete deference to cartel killers over American boys and girls.&nbsp;&nbsp; The time for talk is now over. It\u2019s clear that the Biden administration will not be moved from their acquiescence of lawlessness.

Through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, regulations were proposed that ban lead ammunition in national wildlife refuges across the country. &nbsp;  By all accounts, the action by the USFWS is the first step toward complete prohibition of lead ammunition and tackle on any public lands where you would hunt and fish.&nbsp; Earlier this year, the Biden administration blocked key federal funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) for schools with hunting and archery programs. This federal funding cut would negatively impact millions of American students who participate in those hunting and archery programs. &nbsp; According to the National Archery in the Schools Program, 1.3 million students from 9,000 schools across 49 states are enrolled in archery courses. The number of students participating in hunter education programs in our schools is even higher. Beholden to radical activists, Biden\u2019s Department of Education is depriving millions of kids of longstanding educational and enrichment programs that help foster relationships with role models, build self-esteem, and develop lifelong skills that last well beyond their school years. &nbsp;  In fact, according to a Forbes report, many experts are warning that defunding hunting and archery programs will contribute to the current mental health crisis.&nbsp; While some try to downplay the federal government\u2019s anti-outdoors agenda, the threat to our hunting and fishing way of life is very real.&nbsp; It is abundantly clear that the activists who want to put an end to our outdoor heritage are determined, but they should be warned: so are we.&nbsp; We won\u2019t take this lying down.

Here\u2019s why.&nbsp; The fight the UAW is waging has everything to do with the outrageous level of corporate greed and arrogance on the part of senior executives in the auto industry and their masters on Wall Street.&nbsp; This is an industry that had to be bailed out by U.S. taxpayers in 2008. As part of the bailout autoworkers were forced to make painful economic concessions.&nbsp; STRIKE AT MERCEDES SUPPLIER ZF'S ALABAMA PLANT DEMANDS BETTER PAY AND BENEFITS Today, however, the Big Three are enjoying record-breaking profits. During the first six months of this year, they have made&nbsp;$21 billion in profits&nbsp;\u2013 up 80% from the same time period last year. And, over the past decade, the Big Three have made $250 billion in profits.&nbsp;  While the Big Three are enjoying huge profits and providing their CEOs with exorbitant compensation packages, autoworkers continue to fall further and further behind. Last year, Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors, received&nbsp;$29 million&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;360 times&nbsp;more than the average worker at GM.&nbsp;Over the last nine years,&nbsp;she has made over&nbsp;$200 million&nbsp;in total compensation.&nbsp; The CEO of Stellantis, Carlos Taveras,&nbsp;made $25 million&nbsp;in total compensation last year \u2013 365 times&nbsp;more than the average worker at this company.&nbsp; The CEO of Ford, Jim Farley,&nbsp;made $21 million&nbsp;in total compensation last year \u2013&nbsp;280 times more than the average autoworker at Ford.&nbsp;  Meanwhile, the average wage for an autoworker has&nbsp;gone down by 30%&nbsp;over the past 20 years after adjusting for inflation.&nbsp; While the Big Three could afford to spend $9 billion last year on stock buybacks and dividends, the average starting wage at these companies is just $17 an hour.&nbsp;Unbelievably,&nbsp;workers are leaving the industry to find better paying jobs at McDonald\u2019s.&nbsp; Recently I was able to meet with some of these autoworkers. Here are just few things they shared with me. I was told that some workers were forced to work for 90 days straight for 12 hours a day. Think about that. 90 days straight \u2013 no time off on weekends or special family occasions \u2013 for 12 hours a day. &nbsp; Another worker told me she had worked as a \"temp worker\" from March 2006 to December 2012 and could not even become eligible for a loan to purchase a car from the very plant she works at. Why? Because as a \"temp worker\" her job description did not show the longevity needed to qualify for a car loan. This is the absurdity that the UAW is fighting to reverse.&nbsp;&nbsp;  What the UAW is fighting for is not radical. It is the totally reasonable demand that autoworkers, who have made enormous financial sacrifices over the past 40 years, finally receive a fair share of the record-breaking profits that their labor has generated.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; It means that if the Big Three can afford to give a 40% pay raise to their CEOs and provide billions of dollars to their stockholders, they can afford to provide similar pay raises and cost of living adjustments for the workers who make their products.&nbsp; And let\u2019s be clear. While decent wages are a key demand for the UAW, there are other important contract changes that&nbsp;the union has proposed. &nbsp;  The union, quite appropriately, wants to get rid of the two-tier system under which newer workers earn lower wages and receive less generous benefits than others doing the same exact work. They also want to end the use of \"temporary workers\" who are ruthlessly exploited and treated like second-class citizens after working for these companies year after year after year.&nbsp; At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings and no idea how they will ever be able to retire with any shred of dignity, the UAW is demanding the restoration of pensions and retiree health benefits that were taken away from new hires during the Wall Street crash of 2008.&nbsp; The UAW wants to make sure that autoworkers have the right to strike when the Big Three announces that they will be shutting down another plant. Over the past 20 years,&nbsp;the Big Three have shut down 65 factories&nbsp;and shipped tens of thousands of jobs to Mexico and other low wage countries where they can pay workers starvation wages with no benefits in a destructive race to the bottom.&nbsp; The union also wants to make sure that as the industry proposes to build 10 new Electric Vehicle battery plants that the workers in these plants become part of the UAW and receive the same wages and benefits as union members.&nbsp; While the Big Three could afford to spend $9 billion last year on stock buybacks and dividends, the average starting wage at these companies is just $17 an hour. Unbelievably, workers are leaving the industry to find better paying jobs at McDonald\u2019s. As we transition away from fossil fuels and move toward electric vehicles in the fight to combat climate change the UAW wants to make sure that the green jobs of the future are good-paying, union jobs. &nbsp; Now, I understand that many pundits in the corporate media have been telling the American people how bad a strike will be for the economy and how many billions of dollars the auto industry may lose as a result.&nbsp; Let me offer a different perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my view, when you have autoworkers who cannot afford to buy the cars they make on the assembly line, that is bad for the economy.&nbsp;  When you have autoworkers who cannot afford to take out a mortgage to buy a modest home while the companies they work for make record-breaking profits, that is bad for the economy.&nbsp; When you have autoworkers who can\u2019t afford childcare or to send their kids to college, that is bad for the economy.&nbsp; That is why the UAW is on strike.&nbsp; Let\u2019s be clear. What\u2019s going on in the auto industry is not unique. It\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s been happening all over the American economy.&nbsp;  In the United States today, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality,&nbsp;weekly wages for the average American worker are actually&nbsp;$50 a week&nbsp;lower&nbsp;than they were 50 years ago after adjusting for inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, despite a massive increase in worker productivity in the automobile industry and every other sector of our economy; despite&nbsp;CEOs now making&nbsp;400&nbsp;times more than what their employees earn; despite record-breaking corporate profits; despite corporate America spending hundreds of billions on stock buybacks and dividends, the average American worker is worse off today than he or she was 50 years ago.&nbsp; In America today, over 60% of workers are living paycheck to paycheck. They are living under incredible stress as they worry about how they are going to pay for rent, healthcare, childcare and other basic necessities. Families in the automobile industry and every other industry in America, should not have to live with that kind of stress.&nbsp; CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION What the UAW understands, and all of us should remember, is that over the last 50 years there has been a massive redistribution of wealth in America. Unfortunately, it has gone in exactly the wrong direction. Since 1975, over $50 trillion in wealth has been redistributed from the bottom 90% to the top 1% \u2013&nbsp;primarily because a growing percentage of corporate profits have been flowing into the stock portfolios of the wealthy few.&nbsp; At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings and no idea how they will ever be able to retire with any shred of dignity, the UAW is demanding the restoration of pensions and retiree health benefits that were taken away from new hires during the Wall Street crash of 2008.  In 1937, the UAW played a historic role in American history. The autoworkers of that time had the extraordinary courage to take on the greed and power of the auto industry and formed their union. Their successful sit-down strike in Flint, Michigan, ignited a grassroots movement across the country that helped create an American middle class which became the envy of the world.&nbsp; Now in the year 2023 \u2013 86 years later \u2013&nbsp;the UAW, once again, is helping to lead the effort to rebuild and grow a middle class that has been beaten down by their corporate bosses for far too long. &nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Their fight against corporate greed is the fight to improve the lives of every worker in America.&nbsp; As the Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I am very proud to stand in solidarity with the UAW and I will do everything that I can do to make sure they receive a fair contract.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

But Sabathia hit \"rock bottom\" and needed to find help to get back on the right path. German\u2019s rock bottom came this season when he had a clubhouse incident in which he reportedly \"grew belligerent\" and witnesses \"determined that German was under the influence of alcohol.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The Yankees announced on Aug. 2 that German voluntarily entered a treatment facility for alcohol abuse and would be placed on the restricted list where he\u2019s expected to remain for the rest of the season.&nbsp; \"It is critical Domingo completely focuses on addressing his health and well-being. We will respect his privacy as he begins this process,\" the Yankees said in a statement. With German on the path to recovery, Sabathia shared the key to what helped him curb his addiction. \"Just to really dig in and figure out what the problem is,\" Sabathia said at his PitCCh In Foundation\u2019s 3rd annual Charity Golf Tournament in New Jersey. \"For me, going to rehab, it was the last resort. I had hit rock bottom, so I was ready to figure out why I couldn\u2019t stop drinking. Only until he\u2019s ready to figure it out, or he\u2019s ready to stop, he\u2019ll stop or try to get the help to stop. You can\u2019t force anybody to not be an addict.\" YANKEES CLUBHOUSE INCIDENT LED DOMINGO GERMAN TO ENTER ALCOHOL ABUSE TREATMENT CENTER: REPORT As Sabathia points out, all recovering addicts know you must accept the problem and face it head-on yourself at the end of the day. A great support system, like the Yankees are in this case as well as friends and family, goes a long way, too. \"I just know that, obviously, the steps that are being taken today by Domingo are very important and necessary. And hopefully it can be a game-changer,\" Yankees GM Brian Cashman said in August. Manager Aaron Boone added, \"In some way, this goes back years. I mean, I think all of us can probably have someone in our life that we can relate to. It\u2019s always an ongoing battle. So, I don\u2019t know as far as recent history or since things before that he\u2019s dealt with going back to like \u201919.\" German hasn\u2019t previously had alcohol abuse issues reported by the Yankees, but he did have an incident with his girlfriend in 2019 that led to an 81-game suspension issued by MLB.  It came at a gala hosted by Sabathia, who was in his final year as a Yankee, where German was seen slapping his girlfriend at the event, according to The Athletic. German was intoxicated at the time and reportedly got violent after the gala. No police report was filed because authorities were never called. However, MLB stepped in and suspended German on Jan. 2, 2020, and he missed the entire 60-game COVID-shortened season. He was eventually reinstated on Oct. 6, 2020. \"I was able to speak to each player on the team,\" German said in a statement during 2021 spring training. \"The only acceptable way to begin to move forward was to address them face-to-face. It is worth repeating again today what I told the team. There are a lot of young players who wear this uniform, and I want them to understand the great damage that can be done when mistakes like mine have been made.\" CC SABATHIA LOOKS AHEAD TO INEVITABLE A'S FUTURE IN LAS VEGAS AS OAKLAND COMMUNITY REELS: \u2018IT\u2019S TOUGH' This season has truly been a roller coaster for German, with its clear highlight being the 24th perfect game thrown in MLB history on June 29 against the Oakland Athletics. It was the fourth perfect game in Yankees history. Over 20 games (19 starts), German finished with a 4.56 ERA in 108.2 innings with 114 strikeouts. Before German can start thinking about baseball again, though, he must tackle a different challenge \u2013 one that affects him on and off the diamond. \"The ball\u2019s in his court, and it\u2019s on him to really do the work to figure out what\u2019s going on with him,\" Sabathia said. Sabathia returned to the pitcher\u2019s mound in 2016 and didn\u2019t retire until after the 2019 campaign when he was 38 years old.  Since retiring, Sabathia has focused on continuing to grow the game of baseball through his role as an adviser to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred as well as being vice president of The Players Alliance, which is focused on building equitable systems in order to change the trajectory of diversity throughout baseball.&nbsp; Sabathia\u2019s PitCCh In Foundation also aids in that effort, and it's got family ties with his wife, Amber, serving as its executive director.

Nearly half (46%) of parents in the U.S. have given melatonin to a child under the age of 13, and almost one-third (30%) of parents have given the supplement to a teen over the age of 13 to help him or her fall asleep, according to a recent survey from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). Providing melatonin to children might seem like a natural solution \u2014 but a 2022 AASM health advisory warns against using it for children because melatonin is not regulated by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). MELATONIN GUMMIES FOUND TO CONTAIN POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LEVELS OF THE HORMONE: STUDY The rise in melatonin use has also led to a spike in reports of melatonin overdose, calls to poison control centers and emergency room visits among children, the AASM has stated. Dr. Anne Marie Morse, a pediatric neurologist in Danville, Pennsylvania, was not surprised to hear about the high prevalence of melatonin use among kids.  \"We've seen that in pediatrics, it is much more likely for there to be a prescription to help a child sleep as opposed to adults,\" she said in an interview with Fox News Digital.&nbsp; \"So, it doesn't surprise me that even before a prescription is given, a parent is asking, \u2018What can I do myself? What can I get my hands on to be able to help my child sleep?\u2019\" MELATONIN SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN CHILDREN UNLESS DIRECTED BY A HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL, SAYS SLEEP ACADEMY \"Because when your child's not sleeping, the whole house isn't sleeping and it can be extraordinarily disruptive,\" she added. Overall, Morse sees melatonin as relatively safe. But she emphasized the need to talk with a doctor before doling it out.  \"If you're going to give your child any supplements, you should really have a conversation with your physician first, to make sure it\u2019s the right solution for the problem you\u2019re experiencing,\" she said. \"The doctor can also discuss dosing and how long to utilize it.\" As a sleep physician who sees kids and adults, Morse said she \"commonly\" utilizes melatonin, especially for teenagers who have a delayed sleep phase, meaning that their circadian rhythm has shifted much later than what it should be.&nbsp; PEDIATRIC EXPERTS GIVE NEW RECOMMENDATIONS TO KEEP SLEEPING BABIES SAFE \"Melatonin can be very helpful in shifting the circadian rhythm,\" she said.&nbsp; When using it for that purpose, Morse usually recommends much lower doses \u2014 sometimes as low as 0.3 to 0.5 mg \u2014 and using it further away from bedtime. When using melatonin just for the purpose of helping someone fall asleep, she said she may recommend higher dosing \u2014 anywhere between 1 and 10 mg \u2014 and recommend taking it closer to bedtime.  As far as how long melatonin is used, Morse said it depends on the patients.&nbsp; \"Research has demonstrated that some populations, such as individuals with autism spectrum disorder, require longer-term treatment with melatonin,\" she said. One of the biggest concerns is that melatonin is a hormone produced by the brain, Morse noted, and could potentially influence other hormones the body produces.&nbsp; \"In 2022, there was a 600% increase in poison control calls related to taking too much melatonin.\" In animal studies, melatonin has been shown to affect the sex hormones, which can influence the timing of puberty, she warned. \"That's why we tend to be cautious about long-term use if it's not necessary,\" she said.  Morse\u2019s typical approach is to start the medication, identify whether there's a benefit within three months, then take away the melatonin and gauge whether the benefit is still there.&nbsp; \"The goal is to partner any medication with behavioral strategies that make the medication less necessary for long-term use,\" she said. Lack of regulation  Another potential concern, Morse noted, is that there is a \"high degree of variability\" in how much melatonin may be in any given product.&nbsp; In a recent study from earlier this year, it was found that there could be anywhere from half of what was being stated on the bottle to as much as four times the amount, she said.&nbsp; SIDS LINKED TO BRAIN ABNORMALITY THAT INCREASES BABIES\u2019 RISK IN \u2018UNSAFE SLEEP CONDITIONS,\u2019 STUDY FINDS \"The challenge is that because it's not a regulated substance in the U.S., there is a lack of predictability,\" she said. To reduce the risk, Morse recommended starting with the lowest available dose. \"That way, you know the child won\u2019t get too high of a dose, because there really is no way to predict how much the bottle is going to have.\"  A study in April by the Cambridge Health Alliance revealed that some melatonin gummies \u2014 which can be more appealing to kids \u2014 contained amounts far in excess of what the label indicated. \"If consumers decide to try melatonin \u2014 particularly if giving it to children \u2014 they should seek out a product that is certified by either USP (United States Pharmacopeia) or NSF (formerly the National Sanitation Foundation, now NSF International), as that is the only way to be certain that the product is accurately labeled,\" study author Dr. Pieter Cohen, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Somerville, Massachusetts, told Fox News Digital at the time. \"It\u2019s hard to say whether the short-term benefits outweigh the possible risks.\" Although melatonin is a natural hormone, it is possible for people to have adverse effects from taking too much, Morse confirmed. \"In 2022, there was a 600% increase in poison control calls related to taking too much melatonin,\" the doctor said.&nbsp; \"Thankfully, there hasn\u2019t been any evidence that it can cause something like respiratory depression, coma or death \u2014 but it can cause adverse effects like oversedation, nausea and grogginess the next day,\" she noted.  One study has suggested that melatonin in high doses and for prolonged periods of time could potentially increase the risk of seizures, Morse said, but \"that has not been replicated.\" While melatonin has a role in improving sleep, the doctor noted that it doesn\u2019t treat all types of sleep disorders. \"Just like any medical disorder, it is important to make sure that you're identifying and treating the right one,\" she said. \"Make sure to talk with your physician and see a sleep doctor if necessary, to make sure you're getting the appropriate treatment.\" WANT TO LOWER YOUR RISK OF DYING? GETTING A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP IS MORE URGENT THAN EVER Dr. Laura Purdy, a board-certified family medicine physician in Miami, reiterated that the long-term effects of melatonin on kids aren\u2019t known, as there isn\u2019t yet enough research. \"I would use caution on things we don\u2019t know more about long-term,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s hard to say whether the short-term benefits outweigh the possible risks.\" Potential short-term risks include increased bedwetting; agitation and mood swings; fatigue and drowsiness; stomach pains; and nausea, Purdy warned.&nbsp; \"Just like any medical disorder, it is important to make sure that you're identifying and treating the right one.\" \"Long-term risks that are being looked into more include worries about negative impacts on your child\u2019s growth and development,\" she added. \"There are other ways to help your child fall asleep that I suggest trying first,\" she said. \"If you have any questions or concerns, consult your doctor.\" Importance of good 'sleep hygiene' As far as how much sleep kids need, Morse said it varies by age. \"Generally, the younger you are, the more sleep you require,\" Morse said. \"The pattern and duration of sleep changes over time.\"  Newborn babies need around 14 to 17 hours a day, fragmented across the 24-hour period, she said. Five-year-old children generally need 10 to 13 hours of sleep at nighttime. For adolescents, around eight to 10 hours of sleep is needed. \"All of these are given in a range because it's not one size fits all,\" Morse said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER The quality of a child\u2019s wakefulness during the day can also help parents understand the personalized amount of sleep that is needed. \"If you're noticing impaired quality of wakefulness, which can look like moodiness, irritability, inappropriately falling asleep or reemergence of naps,\" that can indicate the need to see a sleep doctor, Morse said. For parents of children who tend to be more wound-up or anxious, additional activities, like writing in a \"worry journal\" before bed, can help promote better sleep. Good sleep hygiene is also important, Morse said \u2014 while it might not fix existing sleep problems, it can prevent them from developing.&nbsp; \"Sleep hygiene refers to behaviors prior to bedtime that align with sleepiness,\" she said. That might mean having a consistent \"wind-down\" routine each night that will trigger the child's brain to associate it with going to sleep.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"That can start with simple things like brushing teeth and washing up, putting on pajamas and then doing a relaxing activity, whether it's reading a book, listening to relaxing or lulling music, or doing some light stretching,\" Morse said.

So, against the advice of my agents, I said yes,\" she explained. Herb Ritts, the famed fashion photographer, was the person who arranged the photo shoot for Crawford. \"Herb Ritts was someone that I worked with a lot,\" she said. \"I stayed at his house, and we were very good friends.\" Pay was not one of Crawford's requirements, but one them was \"as long as I can have control of the images, and I wanted the right to kill the story if I don't like it.\"  She explained, \"Herb and I combined it with another trip that we were doing for French Vogue to Hawaii. We'd shoot a picture for French Vogue, and then we'd shoot a picture for Playboy. I mean, you almost couldn't tell which pictures were for French Vogue and which pictures were for Playboy. It was very organic, and I loved them.\" \"That's the whole thing for me is, even if I make choices that other people disagree with or don't like, if they're my decisions and I have control of it, that's empowering to me,\" Crawford said. \"Even if it's doing Playboy. I never felt like a victim of that decision.\" Crawford's decision to pose for the publication presented new business opportunities for her. In the late '80s, MTV launched a television series in which it focused on up-and-coming fashion trends, and Crawford was slated at the host.  \"Fashion still was primarily female, and then all of a sudden Playboy was primarily guys,\" she said. \"It was a very different thing. I doubled my audience by doing that. And those two things together led to MTV. They wanted someone, like a model or someone from fashion, but they also wanted someone who had male fans.\" CINDY CRAWFORD BODY-SHAMED OVER BIKINI PHOTO: 'GETTING A LITTLE OLD FOR THIS' Crawford added, \"I had no training in broadcasting. It was bringing together music and fashion and pop culture and putting it into a mixing bowl, and we didn't really care what came out.\" The supermodel enjoyed hosting the MTV show \"House of Style\" because it allowed her to put her personality on display.  \"It gave me an opportunity to talk, and I was able to bring a little bit more of myself to my public persona,\" Crawford said. \"That all felt very empowering to me.\" LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

The nearly 2,000-year-old Domus Tiberiana was home to rulers in the ancient city\u2019s Imperial period. The sprawling palace allows for sweeping views of the Roman Forum below. The public is now able to tour it, following decades of structural restoration work to shore the palace up for safety reasons. Excavations uncovered artifacts from centuries of Roman life following the decline of the empire. The director of the Colosseum Archeological Park, which includes the Palatine Hill, in a written description of the restored palazzo, dubbed it \"the power palace par excellence.\" WHY ARE MEN OBSESSED WITH THE ROMAN EMPIRE? HISTORY EXPERT SAYS IT\u2019S A \u2018VERY AMERICAN THING\u2019 On the eve of the reopening, the official, Alfonsina Russo, quoted a first-century Roman poet as saying the sprawling palace seemed \"infinite\" and that \"its grandiosity was just like the grandiosity of the sky.\"  Although the domus, or residence, is named after Tiberius, who ruled the empire after the death of Augustus, archeological studies indicated that the palace's foundations date from the era of Nero, shortly after the fire of 64 A.D that devastated much of the city. After the demise of the Roman Empire, the residence suffered centuries of abandonment, until when, in the 1500s, the Farnese noble family developed an extensive garden around the ruins. Thanks to the palazzo's reopening to the public, visitors today can get a better idea of the path ancient emperors and their courts enjoyed en route to the domus. The English word \"palatial\" is inspired by the sumptuous imperial residence atop the Palatine, one of ancient Rome's seven hills. The domus, built on the northwest slope of the hill, is considered to be the first true imperial palace. Besides the emperor's residence, the complex included gardens, places of worship, quarters for the Praetorian Guard that protected the ruler and a service district for workers that overlooked the Roman Forum. RESEARCH UNCOVERS SECRET THAT MADE ANCIENT ROMAN CONCRETE SO DURABLE Excavation and restoration work, carried out also during the coronavirus pandemic when for months tourism was at a minimum, helped archeologists piece together what Russo calls centuries of history in a place that \"somehow went forgotten.\" On display for those visiting the reopened domus is a selection of hundreds of artifacts that were found, including objects in metal and glass.

Libby, 56, moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, four years ago, in part to be closer to the doctors treating her for pancreatic cancer. But the landlord wants her out by the end of the month and she can\u2019t find anything else she can afford. She earns only a little more than minimum wage at a hardware store and often has to take unpaid time off because of health problems. Libby thought she found a potential solution nearly a year ago: She applied for state public housing, a type of subsidized housing that\u2019s almost unique to Massachusetts. But she\u2019s heard nothing since. \"It\u2019s frightening,\" she said. \"I seriously don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s like the system\u2019s broken.\" HOW PROGRESSIVES' GRAND PLANS FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING HAVE HARMED AFRICAN AMERICANS In Massachusetts, which has some of the country\u2019s most expensive real estate, Libby is among the 184,000 people on a waitlist for the state\u2019s 41,500 subsidized apartments. Yet a WBUR and ProPublica investigation found that nobody is living in nearly 2,300 state-funded apartments, with most sitting empty for months or years. The state pays local housing authorities to maintain and operate the units whether they\u2019re occupied or not. So the vacant apartments translate into millions of Massachusetts taxpayer dollars wasted due to delays and disorder fostered by state and local mismanagement.  As of the end of July, almost 1,800 of the vacant units had been empty for more than 60 days. That\u2019s the amount of time the state allows local housing authorities to take to fill a vacancy. About 730 of those have not been rented for at least a year. Doris Romero, a housing coordinator at a Boston shelter, was stunned to hear about all the vacant apartments. \"Honestly, that\u2019s a travesty,\" she said. \"The commonwealth should be ashamed.\" Ed Augustus, the state\u2019s new secretary of housing, who was sworn in at the beginning of June, said there\u2019s no justification for so many empty units. \"I think it\u2019s unacceptable,\" he said. Augustus said the state is making changes and he expects improvements soon. In most states, low-income residents seeking affordable housing rely on federal housing, vouchers for private housing and other assistance. But Massachusetts is one of four states \u2014 alongside New York, Connecticut and Hawaii \u2014 that also has state funded housing. And the Massachusetts system is by far the biggest state funded housing system in the country \u2014 with more units than the other three states combined. The vacancies in state-funded housing are aggravating a housing crisis in Massachusetts. Gov. Maura Healey declared a state of emergency in August to deal with the wave of homelessness. Massachusetts reports that the number of families with children staying in shelters has almost doubled in the past year to 6,386. Massachusetts spends $45 million a month to house people temporarily at hotels, shelters, college dorms and a military base. WBUR found there are several reasons for the vacancies in the state-funded housing system, including a flawed online waitlist, insufficient funding for staff and repairs, and apartments being used for things other than housing. Local housing officials blame the state\u2019s online waitlist system for hundreds of the vacancies. \"I think it\u2019s the most horrible, horrible, inefficient program,\" said David Hedison, executive director at the housing authority in Chelmsford, a town 30 miles northwest of Boston. He said the agency spent six months contacting 500 people who were on the waitlist for a three-bedroom apartment, before it finally found one who responded and qualified for the unit. Historically, local agencies with state-funded housing each managed their own small waitlists of applicants. People interested in housing had to apply to separate local housing agencies, often in person. Advocates complained it was too cumbersome. So Massachusetts launched a new system four years ago to make it easier for people to apply anywhere in the state online. Since then, Hedison and other local housing officials have cited a litany of problems. Applicants often fill out the lengthy forms incorrectly. And because there\u2019s no upfront screening, housing officials only catch the errors late in the process \u2014 when they are already holding open apartments for people who don\u2019t qualify for housing or need to be moved lower down the priority list. People desperate for housing are often applying for housing all over the state. Housing officials all draw names from the same central database, so it\u2019s common for multiple housing authorities to screen the same applicant at the same time, duplicating efforts and delaying the process. Some people wind up applying for towns too far from their family or work, and ultimately don\u2019t accept the units. MASSACHUSETTS ADOPTS NEW SEX EDUCATION GUIDELINES FOR SCHOOLS, MOVES TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE OF LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY \"It\u2019s an exercise in futility,\" said Maureen Cayer, the housing authority director in Agawam in Western Massachusetts, where four units have been vacant for more than two years as of July. To speed up the application process, the state hired a marketing firm to take over some of the screening of public housing applicants, starting this month. In addition, hundreds of other apartments can\u2019t be filled because they\u2019re undergoing repairs or because local housing authorities lack the staff or funding for vital repairs. Advocates pushed the Legislature to double the operating budget for public housing this fiscal year, but lawmakers approved a smaller 16% increase to $107 million. In the meantime, local officials say it routinely takes them months to turn over units because they don\u2019t have enough workers. Neglected repairs have piled up for so long that units in the town of Adams, in the Berkshires near the New York state border, were condemned. Housing officials have razed dilapidated apartments in cities such as Lowell, northwest of Boston, and Fall River, near the Rhode Island line. The state estimates there\u2019s a $3.2 billion backlog for renovations. Healey said the state is working on a bond bill to address the infrastructure problems, but declined to provide details. Across the state, housing authorities have also converted at least 121 state-subsidized apartments for uses including offices, storage areas, laundry rooms, and even a police station \u2014 further shrinking the pool of units available for low-income families, seniors and people with disabilities. Meanwhile people like Libby, the Worcester woman facing eviction at the end of September, are desperate to find affordable housing. She was surprised to hear about all the units sitting vacant across the state. \"It\u2019s frustrating,\" she said. \"It\u2019s maddening.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T07:33:59-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Davante-Adams3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Raiders\u2019 Davante Adams rips Bills\u2019 Taylor Rapp over \u2018out of control\u2019 hit during Week 2 blowout", "content": "Las Vegas Raiders star Davante Adams took a big hit late in the team\u2019s loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

DHS announced it will be both extending and redesignating Afghanistan for Temporary Protected Status \u2013 which shields nationals already in the country from deportation and allows them to apply for work permits due to conditions in their home country.&nbsp; The designation is typically based on conditions in the designated country and is based on three grounds: armed ongoing conflict, environmental disasters or \"extraordinary and temporary conditions.\" Officials cited conditions including armed conflict in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has retaken control. DHS TO OFFER WORK PERMITS, DEPORTATION PROTECTION TO OVER 470,000 VENEZUELANS AMID NEW BORDER SURGE  \"Today\u2019s announcement to extend and redesignate TPS for Afghanistan allows us to continue to offer safety and protection to Afghan nationals who are unable to return to their country,\" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. \"DHS will continue to support Afghan nationals through this temporary form of humanitarian relief.\" Extending TPS means that the estimated 3,100 already protected by prior designations are granted additional benefits until May 2025. The redesignation opens up to new applicants who arrived between March 2022 and Wednesday. DHS estimates it will open the program up to 14,600 additional Afghans.&nbsp; Afghans who were paroled into the United States as part of the evacuation from Afghanistan in 2021 can technically apply for TPS, but DHS said it encourages them to seek \"more durable immigration pathways\" for which they may be eligible than the more limited TPS. The move comes a day after a broader re-designation of Venezuela for TPS on Wednesday, which affects a much larger population of around 472,000 Venezuelans with a cut-off date of July 31 for eligibility. The re-designation of Venezuela had been called for by officials in New York and elsewhere, who have been overwhelmed with a surge of migrants who have traveled to those jurisdictions and are unable to work. It came hours after thousands of Venezuelans surged into Eagle Pass, Texas -- although the designation will not directly affect them. LEAKED IMAGES SHOW BIDEN ADMIN'S PLANNED ICE ID CARD FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS  The southern has been seeing rapidly increasing numbers of migrants arriving at the southern border from countries across the globe \u2013 with immigration activists pushing for additional TPS designations and re-designations to prevent deportations and allow them to work. \"We encourage the Biden administration to continue granting TPS designations to vulnerable populations amid unprecedented and ongoing global displacement,\" Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, President and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement. \"As we\u2019ve witnessed with Venezuelans, Ukrainians and other groups, TPS is a valuable tool to help stabilize those hoping to rebuild their lives in the U.S. and expand protection for people unable to return to their home countries.\" THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS GATHER UNDER TEXAS BRIDGE AS BORDER NUMBERS SKYROCKET  But conservatives say the TPS authority, which was authorized by Congress in the 1990s, has been abused and has become distorted from its initial intent and is now anything but temporary. \"I can\u2019t remember a time when a Democratic administration terminated a TPS determination,\" Lora Ries, Director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital on Thursday. \"The Trump administration terminated some TPS programs and the Left sued to keep them going.

Capote, who died in 1984 shortly before his 60th birthday, spent much of his latter years struggling to write his planned Proustian masterpiece \"Answered Prayers,\" of which only excerpts were released. As a young man, he wrote a novel about a love affair between a socialite and a parking lot attendant that was published posthumously under the title \"Summer Crossing.\" Shorter work, too, was sometimes abandoned, including a piece released this week for the first time. Capote was in his mid-20s and a rising star when he moved from New York City to Taormina, Sicily, in 1950 and settled in a scenic villa named Fontana Vecchia, once occupied by D.H. Lawrence. Acclaimed for his debut novel, \"Other Voices, Other Rooms,\" and for his eerie short story \"Miriam,\" Capote would describe the move to Europe as a needed escape from the American literary scene, which he likened to living inside a light bulb, and an ideal setting to get work done: He wrote the novel \"The Grass Harp\" in Sicily and worked on numerous short stories. \"I am so happy to be writing stories again \u2014 they are my great love,\" he wrote to a friend. BOOKS TO READ OR BUY AS GIFTS: HERE ARE 30 GREAT CHOICES TO CONSIDER THIS FALL One story from Sicily, \"Another Day In Paradise,\" is an unfinished work that appears in the new issue of The Strand Magazine. Written at a time of relative contentment for Capote, \"Another Day\" is a narrative of disillusion and entrapment: The middle-aged American heiress Iris Greentree has used her inheritance \u2014 a small one because her mother didn't trust her with money \u2014 to buy a villa in Sicily. She will end up betrayed by the local man who persuaded to invest her money, Signor Carlo Petruzzi, and too broke to sell the home and return to the U.S.  \"The past had trained her to envision an affair from a futureless angle; at the most, she hoped such episodes would end in friendship. It was so humiliating that Carlo should have turned out not to be a friend. She\u2019d trusted him to the extent of her capital: let him sell her the land, allowed him to build the villa, supply, at pirate prices, the native paraphernalia that furnished it,\" Capote wrote. \"He was an emotional crook and, beyond that, a common gangster who\u2019d pocketed at least half the money supposedly spent on Belle Vista. All this she could forgive him \u2014 could, but didn\u2019t. The unforgivable aspect of the ghastly man\u2019s behavior was that it had destroyed the meaning of these lines in her journal: `I belong. At last, somewhere.'\" Much of Capote's fiction was set in New York or in the American South, but \"Another Day in Paradise\" has the easy pace, decorative language and cutting \u2014 sometimes cruel \u2014 humor of his best known work, and the themes of loneliness, fear and regret. Thomas Fahy, author of \"Understanding Truman Capote,\" says that the author likely related to Iris Greentree's sense of displacement and alienation. \"He was constantly moving around as a child, from New Orleans to Alabama to New York to Connecticut,\" Fahy says. \"You could see how his life became very lonely and isolated.\" The Strand has published rare works by Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and many others. Managing editor Andrew Gulli found the Capote story in the Library of Congress, inside an \"old red- and gold-scrolled Florentine notebook,\" he writes on the Strand editorial page. The handwritten manuscript, worked in pencil, was at times so hard to make out that Gulli needed a transcriber to help prepare it for publication. AUTHORS' BOOK ON HOMETOWN MURDER MYSTERY HELPS LEAD TO RETIRED PASTOR'S ARREST IN GIRL'S 1975 KILLING Fahy says that Capote\u2019s time in Sicily, where he remained for just over a year, left him with the kind of feelings many authors have when away from their native countries \u2014 a heightened sense of distance from home that likely helped inspire \"Another in Paradise,\" and a heightened clarity, which he drew upon for \"The Grass Harp\" and its memories of his years in Monroeville, Alabama. Capote biographer Gerard Clarke says that the author moved to Sicily in part because his partner, Jack Dunphy, wanted to live overseas, and because the strong American dollar made Italy more affordable than New York.

He has a beautiful young aunt, one of the most attractive girls I have ever known, and I often talk to him about her,\" Capote writes. \"Why, I wanted to know, does A., the aunt, have no beau? Why is she all alone, never at the dances or the Sunday promenades? The ice boy says it is because his aunt has no use for the local men, that she is very unhappy and longs only to go to America.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T08:16:27-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Lindsay-Panthers.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "First trans NFL cheerleader compares role to becoming doctor, says no one will stop \u2018this show\u2019", "content": "Justine Lindsay, the NFL\u2019s first cheerleader to identity as transgender, wants to influence the next generation and compared becoming a member of the Carolina Panthers TopCats cheerleading squad to other accomplishments like becoming a doctor or nurse. \"I want to change the narrative for my trans sisters and brothers, just to [let them] know that if you have a goal, go for it,\" the cheerleader said. \"Turn that dream into a reality.

This is the timeline set out by Congress and agreed to by President Biden as part of the debt ceiling deal signed in early June. Sadly, the president is yet again trying to circumvent the law so that borrowers can skip their payments with minimal penalties. Instead of following the schedule, the Biden Education Department will allow for a one-year grace period in which borrowers who do not make loan payments will not be \"considered delinquent, reported to credit bureaus, placed in default, or referred to debt collection agencies.\" Interest still accrues, but it will not capitalize after the grace period. The Department of Education calls this a \"safety net.\" To Congress and to taxpayers, it\u2019s a slap in the face. The Biden administration seems to have forgotten that the payment pause and interest freeze is itself a safety net, and a generous one at that. By the time October 1t rolls around, the \"emergency\" policy will have lasted for 40 months, far longer than the emergency itself.&nbsp; Everyone has known since June 3, when the president signed the debt ceiling bill, that borrowers would need to restart paying their loans in October. Based on the administration\u2019s own communications, borrowers should have been prepared much earlier: In August of last year, Sec. Cardona told the public that the final extension would expire at the end of 2022. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION  Now, loan servicers will send bills (or whatever one might call a bill that comes with an \"out\" for those who don\u2019t want to pay). This is President Biden\u2019s Plan C to force taxpayers to pay off student debt: Plan A was his ill-conceived bailout, quashed by the Supreme Court. Plan B is his new Income-Driven Repayment plan, which is estimated to cost taxpayers up to $558.8 billion over ten years.&nbsp; While this Plan C rolls out, he\u2019s hard at work on Plan D, which is using the federal rulemaking process to ensure the burden of student debt is permanently shifted from borrowers and to their fellow Americans. The \"on-ramp\" is a one-year ploy to buy time until the administration can enact a rule to accomplish what his previous plans have not: Mass loan forgiveness without the consent of Congress. JUSTIN HASKINS: BIDEN JUST QUIETLY CREATED THE LARGEST STUDENT DEBT HANDOUT PROGRAM IN U.S. HISTORY  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP All of this raises deeper questions. The Biden administration treats the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio like a bag of treats for its supporters with the taxpayers left holding the bag. The die is cast, and Democrat presidents will always look for ways to cancel student loans until Congress either gets the federal government out of the student loan business or mandates the Department of Education to manage student loans as a fiduciary for the taxpayer.&nbsp; If the Department handled student loans like a business, and if more college programs delivered a return on investment for borrowers, student loans would be a net benefit to the federal balance sheet. President Biden\u2019s mismanagement of the program has made that scenario a distant dream. The Biden administration has not given up on robbing taxpayers of money we are owed. All that\u2019s changed is how they plan to pull off the heist.

Judge&nbsp;James Cain of the Western District of Louisiana granted a preliminary injunction request from plaintiffs \u2014 the State of Louisiana, industry association American Petroleum Institute (API) and oil companies Chevron and Shell \u2014 to block the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) restrictions on Lease Sale 261. The lease sale spanning millions of acres across the Gulf of Mexico is slated for next week. Cain ruled the federal government must proceed with the lease sale by Sept. 30 under its original conditions. As a result of a July settlement with environmental groups, BOEM removed about six million acres from the sale and imposed various restrictions on oil and gas vessels associated with the leases auctioned to protect the Rice\u2019s whale species found in parts of the Gulf of Mexico. \"The court observes that plaintiffs have demonstrated substantial potential costs resulting from the challenged provisions,\" Cain wrote in his decision. \"While the government defendants largely focus on the acreage withdrawal and dynamics of the sale itself, many of plaintiffs\u2019 alleged hardships arise from the vessel restrictions.\"&nbsp; WHITE HOUSE REFUSES TO REVEAL HOW COSTLY POTENTIAL BILLION-DOLLAR CLIMATE PROGRAM COULD BE FOR TAXPAYERS  \"Industry plaintiffs have shown a likelihood that these will burden their operations on current and planned leases,\" the ruling continued. \"The resulting costs would not be undone by the court\u2019s entry of a permanent injunction and order of another sale.\" Cain also said the Biden administration's actions appeared to be an attempt to \"provide scientific justification to a political reassessment of offshore drilling.\" And he said the administration's process looked \"more like a weaponization of the Endangered Species Act than the collaborative, reasoned approach prescribed by the applicable laws and regulations.\" In a statement following the ruling Thursday, API Senior Vice President and General Counsel Ryan Meyers&nbsp;said it was a positive step in ensuring energy security. BIDEN ADMIN QUIETLY CONSULTED LEFT-WING ECO GROUPS ON PLAN TO BLOCK OFF MILLIONS OF ACRES: MONTANA AG \"We are pleased that the court has hit the brakes on the Biden Administration\u2019s ill-conceived effort to restrict American development of reliable, lower-carbon energy in the Gulf of Mexico,\" Meyers said in a statement.&nbsp; \"Today\u2019s decision will allow Lease Sale 261 to move forward as directed by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act, removing the unjustified restrictions on vessel traffic imposed by the Department of the Interior and restoring the more than 6 million acres to the sale,\" he added. \"This decision is an important step toward greater certainty for American energy workers, a more robust Gulf Coast economy and a stronger future for U.S. energy security.\"  In late August, API and its fellow plaintiffs filed the lawsuit against the Biden administration calling for the court to require the Biden administration to \"fulfill its obligations to the American people.\" According to industry, sales like Lease Sale 261, which is the final federal offshore lease sale scheduled, are vital to ensure long-term oil and gas production. Overall, BOEM said \u2014 following its eco settlement in July \u2014 it would offer 12,395 blocks across approximately 67 million acres in multiple regions of the Gulf of Mexico, less than the 13,620 blocks across 73.4 million acres it originally planned to offer. The acreage stripped from the sale included potentially oil-rich tracts located in the middle of the lease area. Offshore lease sales often span large swaths of federal waters, but earn bids on a fraction of blocks projected by companies to contain more resources and to have a higher return on investment. For example, BOEM auctioned off 73.3 million acres during Lease Sale 259 in March, but received bids worth $263.8 million for 313 tracts spanning 1.6 million acres. BIDEN'S LATEST ECO REGS BLASTED BY SMALL BUSINESSES, MANUFACTURERS: 'WILL DO TERRIBLE DAMAGE' \"The injunction is a necessary and welcome response from the court to an unnecessary decision by the Biden administration,\" said Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA). \"The removal of millions of highly prospective acres and the imposition of excessive restrictions stemmed from a voluntary agreement with activist groups that circumvented the law, ignored science, and bypassed public input.\" In addition to removing acreage from the sale, BOEM also imposed restrictions on oil and gas vessel traffic associated with the leases set to be auctioned during Lease Sale 261. Among the requirements, BOEM said specially-trained visual observers must be aboard all vessels traversing the area, all ships regardless of size must travel no quicker than 10 knots and vessels should only travel through the area in the daytime.  BOEM's restrictions came in response to the administration's settlement last month with a coalition of four environmental groups led by the left-wing Sierra Club. In a federal stipulated stay agreement filed on July 21, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) agreed to a number of conditions requested by the groups which, in response, agreed to temporarily pause litigation in the related case. The case dates back nearly three years when, in October 2020, the environmental coalition sued the NMFS for failing to properly assess the oil industry impacts on endangered and threatened marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The groups pursued the lawsuit after the NMFS coordinated a multiagency consultation studying the effects all federally regulated oil and gas activities would have on species like the Rice's whale listed under the Endangered Species Act in the Gulf of Mexico over the next 50 years. The groups argued in the original complaint that the NMFS' biological opinion resulting from its consultation was not based on the best science. API and NOIA also argued BOEM's action had contravened the congressional intent of the Inflation Reduction Act, which reinstated multiple lease sales, including Lease Sale 261, after the Biden administration axed them in May 2022. In the sale's record of decision, it is mandated to be region-wide while its environmental analysis didn't acknowledge risks it may pose to the Rice\u2019s whale.", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T09:30:32-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/931/523/ALL_CUSTOM_FS_LOCAL_NEWS_WI_GENERAL.png?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Wisconsin Republicans move to impeach state elections czar", "content": "A group of Republican Wisconsin lawmakers on Thursday proposed impeaching the battleground state's top elections official as Democrats wage a legal battle to keep the nonpartisan administrator in office. Democrats say the GOP-controlled state Senate acted illegitimately when it voted along party lines last week to oust Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe. In a lawsuit challenging the vote, Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul accused Republicans of attacking the state's elections. The resolution introduced Thursday by five Assembly Republicans makes Wolfe the second state official GOP lawmakers have threatened with impeachment this month. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, Wisconsin's top Republican, created a panel last week to investigate the criteria for impeaching liberal Justice Janet Protasiewicz, whose installment in August tipped the Wisconsin Supreme Court to liberal control for the first time in over a decade. WISCONSIN DEMOCRATS LAUNCH $4M AD BLITZ TARGETING GOP LAWMAKERS CONSIDERING IMPEACHMENT OF NEW LIBERAL JUSTICE Wolfe has been targeted by conspiracy theorists who falsely claim she was part of a plot to rig the 2020 election in favor of President Joe Biden. The lawmakers proposing her impeachment have played a role in advancing those claims and some pushed to decertify the results of the 2020 election.  \"A gaggle of well-known election deniers is once again attacking Meagan Wolfe, a nonpartisan election administrator who has served Wisconsin and our democracy with the utmost respect and dignity,\" Democratic Senate Minority Leader Melissa Agard said in a statement. The 23-page impeachment resolution reiterates conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and faults Wolfe for election administration decisions that were made by elections commissioners. As the elections commission\u2019s nonpartisan administrator, Wolfe has little decision-making power and instead implements decisions made by the three Democrats and three Republicans on the bipartisan commission.

EVERS\u2019 SPECIAL ELECTION ON CHILD CARE, WORKER SHORTAGES REJECTED BY GOP LEGISLATURE \"No matter how many times some politicians misrepresent my actions and how this agency works, it does not make what they\u2019re saying true,\" Wolfe said in a statement. \"It\u2019s irresponsible for this group of politicians to willfully distort the truth when they\u2019ve been provided the facts for years.\" Republican Rep. Janel Brandtjen, one of the resolution's authors, lost her position as chair of the Assembly elections committee and was even kicked out of a GOP caucus last year after Republicans said they lost trust in her for promoting election lies. Brandtjen has frequently butted heads with Vos and other GOP leaders, and she endorsed Vos' Republican primary opponent in the 2022 midterm.

A tentative association was made between Hill and a set of remains recovered at that time, but definitive proof could not be found, and the remains were determined to be unidentifiable, the agency said. They were sent to Hawaii, where they were buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. WORLD WAR II VETERAN'S REMAINS IDENTIFIED 80 YEARS AFTER FATAL MISSION OVER ROMANIA On July 15, 2019, the agency disinterred the remains and sent them to its laboratory for analysis, where they were accounted for as Hill's, it said.

It\u2019s been a colossal waste of millions of dollars,\" Spencer Piston told the student newspaper, The Daily Free Press. Piston is an associate professor of political science, who works as the faculty lead in the Policy office at the Center for Antiracist Research \"CAR.\" Staff and faculty spoke out after CAR recently laid off at least 15-20 employees. Boston University explained that center was restructuring to a \"fellowship model.\" But former staff claimed its founder, Ibram X. Kendi, had told them the past model was not \"financially sustainable.\" Piston claimed the center operated within a \"culture of secrecy\" and had never been transparent about how it managed the millions of dollars in grants and gifts it received since its inception in 2020.&nbsp; BOSTON UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR CALLS LAYOFFS AT IBRAM X. KENDI'S ANTIRACISM CENTER \u2018EMPLOYMENT VIOLENCE\u2019  \"It\u2019s pretty hard for me to imagine they blew through $30 million in two years,\" he told the student newspaper. \"There\u2019s been a lack of transparency about how much money comes in and how it\u2019s spent from the beginning, which comports with a larger culture of secrecy.\" Phillipe Copeland, a clinical associate professor in the BU School of Social Work and former assistant director of the Narrative office at CAR, accused both institutions of spinning the layoffs as a \"redesign rather than an institutional failure, for which people need to be accountable.\"&nbsp; He claimed the organization had lost at least one funder due to the research center's inability to meet goals. He wasn't the only one who shared this sentiment in the report. \"There\u2019s a mismatch between the amount of money that CAR has received from these grants and what they\u2019ve actually produced,\" an anonymous source told the campus newspaper. \"You can juxtapose that with other research centers either at BU or other universities that have received a tiny fraction of what CAR has received and has produced a lot more.\" The Daily Free Press described how the center had failed to produce promised research, despite Kendi touting data science as a \"pillar\" of his center in 2020. CONSERVATIVE EDUCATION ACTIVIST RUNNING FOR CONGRESS AFTER VICTORIES OVER DEI PROGRAMS: \u2018SPEAKING TO FAIRNESS\u2019  \"The Racial Data Lab and the Antiracist Tech Initiative make up the extent of the Center\u2019s data-based output under their Research category, according to CAR\u2019s website,\" the newspaper said. However, the Racial Data Lab's only project was a \"Covid Racial Data Tracker\" which is now-defunct. Staff also complained that Kendi wasn't fit to serve as a leader and claimed his standing as a public figure took prominence over their center's research. \"It was mostly about him, rather than the work, and it was just very difficult to highlight the work over the founder,\" an anonymous former manager in the policy office said in the report. \"Just because you\u2019re a good scholar in your field doesn\u2019t mean that you know how to run an organization, and that\u2019s why lots of people don\u2019t do that,\" Copeland described Kendi. \"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a disciplinary issue as much as just a leadership ability issue.\" Saida Grundy, an associate professor of sociology at BU and former assistant director of narrative at the center, described one year-long policy project as \"deeply anti-intellectual endeavor\" that focused exclusively on Kendi's work, instead of producing a \"scholarly dialogue.\" Kendi was hired by Boston University as a history professor in June 2020, during the height of protests and riots after George Floyd\u2019s death. Shortly afterward, Kendi announced the movement of his antiracist research center from American University, where he previously taught, to Boston University, where he currently sits as the center\u2019s director. BOSTON UNIVERSITY STAFFERS SPEAK OUT AGAINST IBRAM X. KENDI'S CENTER LAYING OFF EMPLOYEES: \u2018EXPLOITATIVE\u2019  He rose to prominence over the last few years for his defense of critical race theory as well as teaching racial concepts to children. He has published several books on the subject of racism including \"How to Be an Anti-Racist\" and the children\u2019s book \"Antiracist Baby.\" Author and critical race theory critic Christopher Rufo shared the report on X and suggested the center's problems were a result of its focus on DEI\u2014Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion \u2014 rather than \"merit.\" \"Boston University is investigating Ibram Kendi's \u2018antiracism\u2019 center, following allegations that he mismanaged grant funding, failed to deliver key projects, and unleashed \u2018employment violence\u2019 on staff,\" Rufo wrote on X. \"This is what happens when DEI replaces merit as the guiding principle.\"  The mass layoffs at the center and complaints from former staff prompted Boston University to announce it was expanding its probe into the center on Thursday. \"We received complaints after the Center for Antiracist Research recently laid off a number of employees. Those complaints focused on the center\u2019s culture and its grant management practices. We previously initiated an examination of those grant management practices and that will continue,\" Boston University PR Associate Vice President Rachel Lapal Cavallario told Fox News Digital. \"Based on additional information provided to us, we are expanding our inquiry to include the Center\u2019s management culture and the faculty and staff\u2019s experience with it. We recognize the importance of Dr. Kendi\u2019s work and the significant impact it has had on antiracist thinking and policy. Boston University and Dr. Kendi believe strongly in the Center\u2019s mission, and while he takes strong exception to the allegations made in recent complaints and media reports, we look forward to working with him as we conduct our assessment,\" the statement concluded.

Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas told CNN's \"OutFront\" Thursday that he declared a state of emergency in his city of 30,000 people after 5,000 migrants crossed over the border into the city from Piedras Negras, Mexico. Salinas said Biden has \"abandoned\" border communities and complained that no one from the White House has reached out amid the crisis.&nbsp; \"I believe 100 percent [Biden] does, he bears some responsibility for this crisis. I haven't heard from anybody in the administration. The president hasn't put out a statement, the vice president, I haven't heard from anybody,\" Salinas said. \"We're here abandoned. We're on the border, we're asking for help. This is unacceptable,\" he stated. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp; OVER 2,200 MIGRANTS CAUGHT ON VIDEO ILLEGALLY CROSSING BORDER NEAR EAGLE PASS, TEXAS, OVERNIGHT, SOURCES SAY  The mayor said Texas agencies have been more responsive, including the Department of Public Safety, and so have Gov. Greg Abbott and federal agencies like Border Patrol. \"They are helping, and they are controlling the situation, as best as they can,\" Salinas said.&nbsp; \"But what's disappointing is that you have all of these thousands of people just walking in, without any consequence whatsoever,\" he added.&nbsp; Earlier this week, Fox News' drone team filmed more than 2,200 migrants heading toward Eagle Pass overnight, in one of the largest border crossings observed by Fox News in the past two years. By Wednesday, Texas troopers told Fox News that number had increased to about 4,000 people, who gathered under a bridge and were waiting to be processed by Border Patrol, in the hopes of being released into the United States.&nbsp; Many of them told Fox News that they were arriving from Venezuela, with some saying they arrived by train from Mexico. The Mexican military deployed on the Mexican side of the border, but it did not stop the migrants from crossing. THOUSANDS OF VENEZUELAN MIGRANTS GATHER UNDER TEXAS BRIDGE AS BORDER NUMBERS SKYROCKET  The U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in crossings at the southern border in recent days. Officials made over 45,000 migrant encounters in the last five days alone, both at the ports of entry and between them, sources told Fox on Wednesday, with multiple days of over 8,000 illegal immigrant encounters. Sources have also told Fox News that there were around 230,000 migrant encounters in August \u2013 Customs and Border Protection has not yet released its official numbers. That 230,000 would be up significantly from over 180,000 in July and 144,000 in June. August\u2019s numbers would mark the highest for any month in 2023. Salinas told CNN the overwhelming number of migrants has forced Eagle Pass to shut down the local international bridge between Mexico and Texas, which is a major economic engine for his city. \"It's become a big concern for the community. A lot of people are frustrated. A lot of these people are being let loose in the community, walking around. And it's just a big concern for the city of Eagle Pass. Not only safety-wise, but also our local economy is taking a hit, because of this crisis, we have to shut down the bridge,\" Salinas said, adding that his local government depends on the tolls from people who use it. PERUVIAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' ALLEGED MURDER VICTIM IS US CITIZEN, SHERIFF CONFIRMS Over the summer, the Biden administration touted a sharp drop in encounters after the ending of Title 42 expulsions in May and attributed it in part to its strategy of expanding \"lawful\" migration pathways, including a parole program that allows up to 30,000 migrants a month from four countries including Venezuela to fly directly into the U.S. legally. The Department of Homeland Security had pointed to an 89% drop in illegal encounters from those four nationalities as proof it was working.&nbsp;  Separately, up to 1,450 migrants each day are being paroled into the U.S. at ports of entry if they use the CBP One app to make an appointment. Those programs were combined with what the administration said was an increase in consequences at the border \u2014 including restored Title 8 removals and an asylum rule limiting asylum claims if migrants entered illegally and failed to claim asylum at a third country. It has also noted that FY 2022 saw a record number of removals under both Title 42 and Title 8 authorities. It had tied the decrease in encounters from May to June as a sign that strategy was successful. The administration has also said it can only do so much given the \"broken\" system within which it is working, and has called on Congress to provide more funding and to pass an immigration reform bill introduced in 2021. Republicans have rejected that bill due to its inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants. The House has passed legislation that would restart border wall construction, increase border security and restrict asylum claims at the border \u2014 which Democrats have outright rejected.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&nbsp; As the political battle over immigration continues, Salinas is asking for the government to enforce existing laws. \"Please, just enforce the laws that are on the books,\" the mayor pleaded on CNN. \"We are a nation of laws. That's all I ask for, is that it shouldn't be like this. We should be able to enforce laws. If you want to come here \u2014 good, come legally. A lot of people have in the past. It takes a lot of money and years to do it the right way. And it's not fair for those people that now we have thousands of people coming in, without one single consequence.

Randy Johnson, the Department of Natural Resources' large carnivore specialist, told the state Senate's sporting heritage committee that a lack of a hard limit gives the agency more flexibility to manage the species, allows local packs to fluctuate and gives the population a better chance at maintaining wolf abundance for years to come. \"The plan recommends adjusting management actions in response to observed real-world conditions,\" Johnson said. WISCONSIN DNR RELEASES 3.5K PUBLIC COMMENTS ON WOLF MANAGEMENT PLAN His remarks came during a hearing on a Republican bill that would force the DNR to set a firm numeric goal in the new plan. Hunting advocates lined up in support of the bill, complaining that the lack of a goal leaves both wolves and people unprotected. \"It\u2019s a pretty reasonable plan, but it has left the door wide open. It doesn\u2019t say where it ends or where it begins,\" said Luke Withrow, vice president of the Wisconsin Bear Hunters Association. \"Most people do not care if there are wolves in Wisconsin \u2026 but you shouldn\u2019t see one every day. It should be that special thing that exists in northern Wisconsin. They shouldn\u2019t be chasing your cattle ... and coming into school playgrounds.\" Wolf population levels have been one of the most contentious outdoor issues Wisconsin has faced in the last 30 years. Farmers across northern Wisconsin complain annually about wolf attacks on their livestock as the species has regained a foothold in the state. Hunters are eager to kill them. Animal rights advocates insist the population is too fragile to support hunting.  The DNR adopted a management plan in 1999 that calls for limiting the population to 350 animals. The latest DNR estimates, though, put the population at around 1,000 animals. Hunters and farmers have pointed to the 350 number as justification for setting high kill quotas. Wisconsin law mandates that the DNR hold an annual wolf hunt. Gray wolves are currently listed on the federal endangered species list, making hunting illegal. The DNR has been working to update its management plan in case wolves are delisted and hunting resumes in the state. WI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO FINALIZE WOLF MANAGEMENT PLAN IN OCTOBER The new plan recommends a statewide population of about 1,000 animals. If the number of wolves falls below 799, wildlife officials should look to grow the statewide population, according to the plan. If the population stands at 800 to 999 wolves, the population could grow or be considered stable. If the population stands at between 1,000 and 1,199 wolves, the population would be considered stable or could be reduced. If the number of animals grows to 1,200 or more, the population should be reduced. The DNR's board is set to vote on the plan in October. Sen. Rob Stafsholt and Rep. Chanz Green have introduced a bill in March that would force the DNR to set a numeric population goal. The bill doesn't set a goal, instead leaving it up to the DNR to determine it. The hearing was a parade of hunting advocates like Withrow, all calling for a hard limit. Tim Fiocchi, a lobbyist for the Wisconsin Farm Bureau, urged the committee to amend the bill to set the goal at 350 wolves. He said the new plan as currently drafted is too ambiguous. George Meyer, a Wisconsin Wildlife Federation board member, echoed him, saying no hard number will lead to endless debate over what population levels are sustainable. The DNR's Johnson countered that a hard population target is ineffective and doesn't take into account local pockets and how the tolerance of wolves varies across the state. He called the new plan \"practical.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The committee adjourned without voting on the bill.", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T12:11:52-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/9597c90c-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Authorities expand \u2018very aggressive\u2019 manhunt for Kevin Mason, homicide suspect mistakenly released from jail", "content": "Authorities in Indiana have expanded a search for Kevin Mason, a homicide suspect who was accidentally released from jail last week.

Bob Menendez, D-N.J., and his wife with violating corruption and bribery laws, according to an indictment unsealed in federal court Friday. According to the indictment, Menendez, who chairs the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and his wife Nadine Menendez are accused of engaging in a corrupt scheme alongside Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer; Wael Hana, who runs a halal meat certification business in the state; and businessman Jose Uribe. The bombshell indictment included sprawling allegations against the senior Democratic senator involving a scheme to aid the Egyptian government, gold bars, money stuffed in envelopes and illicit halal certifications. In a lengthy statement following the indictment, Menendez denied any wrongdoing and said forces \"behind the scenes\" are working to silence him and dig his \"political grave.\" He added his behavior laid out in the indictment was all well within the realm of his office's authority. \"Since this investigation was leaked nearly a year ago there has been an active smear campaign of anonymous sources and innuendoes to create an air of impropriety where none exists,\" he said. FEDS PROBING IF DEM SEN MENENDEZ OR WIFE ACCEPTED GOLD BARS WORTH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS FROM FELON: REPORT  1. Breached official duty in way that \u2018benefited the Government of Egypt\u2019 The federal indictment alleges that Menendez used his power and influence serving in the U.S. Senate to enter into the scheme which ultimately benefited the Egyptian government. It stated that the lawmaker and his wife accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes \"to seek to protect and enrich\" Daibes, Hana and Uribe. The bribes, the indictment continued, included cash, gold bars, home mortgage payments, compensation for no-show jobs, a luxury vehicle and \"other things of value.\" DOJ WEIGHING POTENTIAL CHARGES AGAINST BOB MENENDEZ FOLLOWING CRIMINAL PROBE INTO GIFTS TO HIS WIFE: REPORT \"Among other actions, Menendez provided sensitive U.S. Government information and took other steps that secretly aided the Government of Egypt,\" the indictment stated.&nbsp; \"Menendez&nbsp;also improperly advised and pressured an official at the United States Department of Agriculture for the purpose of protecting a business monopoly granted to Hana by Egypt and used in part to fund the bribes being paid to Menendez&nbsp;through Nadine Menendez,\" it continued.&nbsp;  The scheme arose in 2018 after Nadine Menendez, then Arslanian, began dating Menendez and subsequently introduced him to Egyptian intelligence and military officials \"for the purpose of establishing and solidifying a corrupt agreement\" in which Hana, along with Daibes and Uribe, provided bribes to the Menendez couple. In exchange, Menendez allegedly breached his official duty to benefit Egypt's government with respect to foreign military sales and foreign military financing. In his role as the top Democratic member on the Foreign Relations Committee, Menendez was given substantial access to and possessed substantial influence over foreign military sales and foreign military financing to Egypt, among the top recipients of U.S. foreign aid.

Investigators find cash stuffed in envelopes and Menendez's jackets The indictment further revealed that federal agents conducted a search of Menendez's home last year, when they discovered hidden cash and gold bars. In June 2022, agents raided Menendez's residence and a safe deposit box belonging to Nadine Menendez. They found more than $480,000 in cash, which was largely stuffed into envelopes and hidden in clothing, closets and a safe. They also discovered more than $70,000 in the senator's wife's safe deposit box.  Some of the envelopes containing cash contained DNA belonging to Daibes or his driver. Cash was also located in jackets with Menendez's name stitched on them. One jacket had Menendez's name stitched next to the insignia for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, of which he is a member.

Google search for 'kilo of gold price' Meanwhile, amid the scheme, Menendez, according to the indictment, searched on Google for the \"kilo of gold price.\" The search was an apparent attempt to ascertain how much the gold bars investigators found on his property are worth, according to the indictment.&nbsp; Menendez performed the Google search on Jan. 29, 2022, shortly after his wife allegedly exchanged calls with Daibes' driver and later texted him, \"Thank you. Christmas in January.\" DEM SENATOR CHARGED WITH BRIBERY ONCE CLAIMED TRUMP COULD BE 'COMPROMISED' BY RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT Menendez's search also came shortly after he allegedly spoke on the phone with an Egyptian government official in what was his first contact with that individual. Photographs taken by agents who raided Menendez's home showed gold bars emblazoned with the logo of the Swiss Bank Corporation and markings indicating they weigh one kilogram.  4. Menendez seeks to disrupt federal criminal prosecutions Menendez attempted to influence a pending federal prosecution of Daibes, who is a New Jersey developer and former bank chairman, from around late 2020 until early 2022, according to the indictment.&nbsp; Daibes faced federal bank fraud charges that could have landed him up to a decade in prison for lying about a $1.8 million loan from Mariner's Bank, where he served as chairman. DEMS EMBROILED IN SCANDAL FOR SUPPORTING MASSIVE SPENDING BILL THAT GAVE LARGE SUMS TO THEIR OWN PRIVATE ORGS According to the indictment, Menendez recommended now-U.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger for the position after believing he would be sympathetic to Daibes. Sellinger, however, recused himself.&nbsp; During the process, Menendez and his wife allegedly received cash, gold bars and furniture for his attempts to help Daibes.&nbsp; Last year, New Jersey's U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to let Daibes plead guilty to one count and serve probation. They said Daibes had repaid the loan.  5. Menendez allegedly receives luxury car for disrupting criminal case Two defendants within the indictment, Hana and Uribe, allegedly helped purchase a Mercedes-Benz C-300 convertible valued at over $60,000 for Menendez and his wife. Menendez had agreed to interfere in a New Jersey state criminal prosecution dealing with an associate of Uribe, who faced insurance fraud charges relating to a trucking company and an employee of Uribe, according to the indictment. &nbsp; DEMOCRAT IN VA RACE SAYS \u2018UNQUALIFIED\u2019 WHITES HAVE HIGH-PAYING JOBS THAT BLACK PEOPLE NEED \u2018A PHD\u2019 TO GET Around this time, Menendez's wife had a car accident that left her without a vehicle. She texted Hana about her lack of a car.&nbsp;They agreed that Menendez would then intercede in exchange for a car, according to the indictment. &nbsp;  Menendez allegedly contacted a senior state prosecutor in New Jersey's attorney general's office, attempting \"through advice and pressure\" to cause the individual to resolve the issues favorably for Uribe's associates.&nbsp; Uribe later allegedly met Menendez's wife in a restaurant parking lot and supplied her with $15,000 in cash. The following day, Menendez's wife made a $15,000 down payment on the Mercedes with a combination of cash, a credit card and checks.&nbsp; \"Congratulations mon amour de la vie, we are the proud owners of a 2019 Mercedes,\" Menendez's wife allegedly texted him after she acquired the vehicle.&nbsp; His wife later texted him a picture of the new car, the indictment said.&nbsp; CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T12:40:32-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/380912560_cropped.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "\u2018Dangerous\u2019 convicted child sexual predator who escaped custody back behind bars, police say", "content": "Authorities in Missouri captured a \"dangerous\" convicted sexual predator who had escaped police custody Thursday while serving a 30-year sentence for statutory sodomy.

Sheriff Rochelle Bilal said at a news conference that the controller's report released earlier this week contained \"misleading statements,\" and she questioned the controller's review. Acting City Controller Charles Edacheril said his office conducted the review as a follow-up to a 2020 report that found the sheriff\u2019s office couldn\u2019t account for more than 200 weapons. That report stated that the office had haphazard recordkeeping practices and unclear procedures regarding the handling of guns. THROWN OUT A WINDOW AND LEFT FOR DEAD IN PHILLY\u2019S OPEN-AIR DRUG DEN. NOW SHE HELPS OTHERS ESCAPE ITS GRIP Some of the missing guns were part of the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s arsenal and others were confiscated from people subject to protection-from-abuse orders. Bilal, who took office in 2020, said earlier this year that her department had accounted for all but 20 of the guns cited in the 2020 report, and they were either located or found to have been disposed of or sold. The controller, though, notified the sheriff's office on Wednesday that there wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence to account for 76 of its guns and 109 weapons that were surrendered to the office.  For example, 46 guns that were reported as \"found\" had supposedly been traded or burned. However, the only documentation offered for 36 of them was they were on a list of weapons in a folder labeled \"Weapons Burn List\" that did not include details such as when or where they were disposed of, the report stated. The controller still considers the 185 guns unaccounted for and recommended that the office report them to police as missing. BAIL REVOKED FOR FORMER PHILADELPHIA POLICE OFFICER CHARGED WITH MURDERING EDDIE IRIZARRY On Thursday, Bilal said her office submitted a 159-page response regarding the guns on June 8 that included details of her office's investigation, which concluded that 58 firearms had been found, 20 were still missing and 18 were presumed to have been traded or burned. Three guns on the controller's list were duplicates, she said. Bilal said her office had not been contacted since it submitted its report, calling into question how the controller\u2019s office has handled the current investigation and its expectations. \"Simply put, we cannot answer inconsistencies that derive as a result of that recordkeeping in the past,\" Bilal said, asking why audits were not done five or 10 years ago. She then displayed photos of what the department armory looked like when she took office: boxes of paperwork and firearms on the floor, on top of desks and in corners.

China is the biggest market for Japanese seafood, and the ban has badly hurt Japan's fishing industry. 1ST RELEASE OF TREATED FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR WASTEWATER COMPLETE, OPERATOR SAYS \"China is engaged right now in fishing in Japan\u2019s economic waters while they are simultaneously engaged in the unilateral embargo on Japan\u2019s fish,\" Emanuel said. He said China\u2019s intention is to isolate Japan. Japan began gradually releasing treated wastewater from the crippled Fukushima plant into the sea on Aug. 24. The water has accumulated at the plant since it was crippled by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. China immediately banned imports of Japanese seafood, accusing Tokyo of dumping \"radiation contaminated water\" into the ocean.  The International Atomic Energy Agency has said the release, if carried out as planned, will have a negligible impact on the environment, marine life and human health. Emanuel posted four photos on X, formerly called Twitter, on Friday that he said showed \"Chinese vessels fishing off Japan's coast on Sept. 15, post China's seafood embargo from the same waters. #Fukushima.\" JAPANESE CROWN PRINCE VISITS VIETNAM TO MARK 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS Emanuel has also posted other comments about China that have been interpreted as critical, including one on Sept. 15 about Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu, who has not appeared in public for weeks, speculating he might have been placed under house arrest. On Aug. 8, Emanuel posted that Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s Cabinet lineup was \"resembling Agatha Christies\u2019s novel \u2018And Then There Were None,\u2019\" noting the disappearances of Li, Foreign Minister Qin Gang, and commanders of China's rocket force.

The Biden administration is setting a booby trap in case a Republican wins the presidency in 2024. On Friday, the White House unveiled a proposed rule that would make it even harder than in the past for an incoming Republican president to wrestle control of the left-leaning federal bureaucracy and actually implement the conservative policies promised to voters. Of the 2.2 million federal civil workers, only 4,000 are presidential appointees. The rest stay in their jobs, from one administration to the next, protected by rules that make it nearly impossible to discipline or replace them. FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL FRONTRUNNER, CHALLENGERS AND SECOND PLACE CANDIDATES They overwhelmingly favor the left. A staggering 95% of unionized federal employees who donate to political candidates give to Democrats, according to Open Secrets. Only a tiny 5% support Republicans.  Some federal workers in high positions slow-walk or even derail a Republican president's agenda \u2014 and get away with it. Why bother to vote if the left-leaning deep state stays in charge no matter who wins the presidency? GOP candidates Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy and Ron DeSantis are vowing to conquer this obstructionism. Everett Kelley, union president of the American Federation of Government Employees, claims GOP contenders want to \"politicize routine government work.\" Nonsense. We're not talking about mail carriers. It's time to make lawyers, PhDs and other top-level career bureaucrats implement the president's agenda, not their own.  After Trump won in 2016, they went to town neutralizing him on almost every policy front, explains James Sherk, special assistant to the White House Domestic Policy Council under Trump. WHAT ARE THE FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS? Career lawyers in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division flat out refused to challenge Yale University's discrimination against Asian American applicants. Trump had to recruit lawyers from other divisions. After Joe Biden became president, the DOJ dropped the case. But the same career lawyers who refused to sue Yale made the losing argument in support of affirmative action before the U.S. Supreme Court. Career health officials like Dr. Deborah Birx circumvented Trump's instructions to moderate COVID lockdowns. Environmental Protection Agency lawyers pursued cases against fossil fuel producers and withheld the information from Trump appointees.  Trump mandated in a 2020 executive order that new federal buildings be designed to please the public, which prefers classical designs. Instead, General Services Administration architects chose modern designs they like. Trump mentioned as an example the San Francisco Federal Building, the ugliest edifice in the city. It goes on, including weaponization of the FBI against the president himself. In October 2020, Trump issued an executive order that federal workers who make policy should be reclassified as at-will employees who can be terminated. But before it could be implemented, Biden became president. He canceled it immediately, knowing the bureaucrats were on his side. The rule announced Friday would slow a president's ability to reinstate Trump's order. Democrats in Congress are going further, pushing to eliminate the president's authority to reclassify jobs altogether. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The New York Times announced, \"Biden Administration Aims to Trump-Proof the Federal Work Force.\" Ramaswamy vows to go further than Trump, eliminating half or more of civil service positions. \"Speaking as a CEO, if somebody works for you and you can't fire them, they don't work for you,\" he said in a speech on Sept. 12.  New York Magazine facetiously claims holding employees accountable is a threat to good government, and warns that a Republican victory will mean \"a new class of federal appointees charged with a partisan agenda.\" Democrats and their media allies falsely romanticize civil service, claiming it protects \"merit\" over patronage. Merit was the intention when the civil service was created in 1883 by the Pendleton Act. But merit is largely gone. Scramble those five letters and what you've got is the \"timer\" system. Federal workers get bigger salaries and fatter benefits than private-sector workers doing comparable jobs. And they almost never lose their job, no matter how derelict they are. They put in their time and skate to a gold-plated retirement package.  It's a gravy train, paid for by John Q Public. That's sickening enough. But it's even worse when these civil \"servants\" put their own leftist leanings ahead of the president and public they're paid to serve. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bravo to the GOP candidates pledging to take on the deep state \u2014 replete with deadbeats and lefties \u2014 and return government to the people.

The aim in 2023 was to interrupt the transmission of wild polio in the two countries where it is still endemic, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and do the same for a variant form of polio known as \"vaccine-derived\" that is causing outbreaks elsewhere. The Independent Monitoring Board, a group of polio experts who oversee the work of the U.N.-backed Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), said neither target would be hit this year. The GPEI agreed on both counts, citing insecurity in key locations as one of the remaining challenges and stressing in a statement responding to the review that ending the vaccine-derived outbreaks is likely to take the most time. Wiping out polio, a viral disease that can cause paralysis, has been a key global health aim for decades. Cases have been reduced by more than 99% since 1988 thanks to mass vaccination campaigns, but making polio the second infectious disease ever to be completely eradicated, after smallpox in 1980 \u2013 has proved more difficult. NEW YORK COUNTY CONFIRMS CASE OF POLIO\"But it can be done. And we need to make sure we finish the job,\" said Aidan O'Leary, director of polio eradication at the World Health Organization, a GPEI partner alongside governments and funders like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. There have only been seven cases of wild polio reported this year, five in Afghanistan and two in Pakistan. O'Leary said interrupting transmission of this form of polio was likely to happen by early 2024, just a few months after the target.  This meant the hope of a conclusive end to polio by 2026 remained alive, at least for wild polio, he said in a phone interview with Reuters on Thursday. However, outbreaks linked to vaccine-derived polio are more challenging, he said. This form of polio can occur when children are immunized with a vaccine containing a weakened version of the live virus. They are protected, but the weakened virus excreted by these immunized children can spread and mutate among an unvaccinated population, ultimately becoming harmful. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Such viruses have recently paralyzed nearly 50 times more children than wild poliovirus, the monitoring board review said. The GPEI aims to focus its vaccination and surveillance efforts on the areas where these kinds of polioviruses are concentrated: the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, north western Nigeria, south-central Somalia, and northern Yemen, O'Leary said. \"This is what is needed to shift the game,\" he said. \"Clearly the timelines are under review ... but we can do what has to be done.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T15:09:07-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/ALL_CUSTOM_FS_LOCAL_NEWS_DC_GENERAL.png?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Georgetown women\u2019s basketball coach Tasha Butts takes leave to focus on battle against breast cancer", "content": "Georgetown women's basketball coach Tasha Butts is taking time away from the team to focus on her health in her ongoing battle against breast cancer, the school announced Thursday night.

Jessica Burgess, 42, pleaded guilty in July to tampering with human remains, false reporting and providing an abortion after at least 20 weeks of gestation, which is illegal in Nebraska. Madison County District Judge Mark Johnson sentenced her Friday to one year in prison for each count, with the first two to run concurrently. The sentence for the abortion count was ordered to run after the first two, amounting to a two-year sentence. Online court records show the judge deemed her unsuitable for probation. NEBRASKA WOMAN, 18, GETS 90 DAYS FOR GETTING ILLEGAL ABORTION WITH MOM'S HELP, BURNING FETUS Burgess, of Norfolk, Nebraska, admitted at her plea hearing to helping her then-17-year-old daughter end her pregnancy. As part of her plea, charges of concealing the death of another person and abortion by someone other than a licensed physician were dismissed. Her daughter, Celeste Burgess, who is now 19, was sentenced in July to 90 days in jail and two years of probation for burning and burying the fetus.  The abortion, well into the teen's third trimester, violated Nebraska law at the time that banned abortion after 20 weeks of gestation. Officials have said Jessica Burgess ordered abortion pills online and gave them to her daughter in the spring of 2022. Norfolk police opened an investigation into the abortion following a tip, according to an arrest affidavit. Police secured a search warrant to gain access to Facebook messages between the two, where prosecutors say the women discussed terminating the pregnancy and destroying the evidence. Police then found the burned fetal remains buried in a field north of Norfolk. NEBRASKA MOM PLEADS GUILTY TO HELPING DAUGHTER, 17, OBTAIN ILLEGAL ABORTION In one of the Facebook messages, Jessica Burgess instructed her daughter on how to take the pills to end the pregnancy, according to court records.

The 58-year-old Navy veteran was facing near-certain death from heart failure but other health problems meant he wasn\u2019t eligible for a traditional heart transplant, according to doctors at University of Maryland Medicine. While the next few weeks will be critical, doctors were thrilled at Lawrence Faucette\u2019s early response to the pig organ. \"You know, I just keep shaking my head \u2013 how am I talking to someone who has a pig heart?\" Dr. Bartley Griffith, who performed the transplant, told The Associated Press.

In a statement, his wife, Ann Faucette said: \"We have no expectations other than hoping for more time together.

Last year, there were just over 4,100 heart transplants in the U.S., a record number but the supply is so tight that only patients with the best chance of long-term survival get offered one. Attempts at animal-to-human organ transplants have failed for decades, as people\u2019s immune systems immediately destroyed the foreign tissue. Now scientists are trying again using pigs genetically modified to make their organs more humanlike.  Recently, scientists at other hospitals have tested pig kidneys and hearts in donated human bodies, hoping to learn enough to begin formal studies of what are called xenotransplants. The University of Maryland attempt required special permission from the Food and Drug Administration to treat Faucette outside of a rigorous trial, because he was out of other options. It took over 300 pages of documents filed with FDA, but the Maryland researchers made their case that they\u2019d learned enough from their first attempt last year \u2013 even though that patient died for reasons that aren\u2019t fully understood \u2013 that it made sense to try again. And Faucette, who retired as a lab technician at the National Institutes of Health, had to agree that he understood the procedure\u2019s risks.

He was 98. A statement issued Friday night by the presidential palace confirmed Italian news reports of the death of Napolitano, who had been ailing in a Rome hospital for weeks. The current president, Sergio Mattarella, in a message hailed his predecessor as head of state, saying that Napolitano\u2019s life \"mirrored a large part of (Italy's) history in the second half of the 20th century, with its dramas, its complexity, its goals, its hopes.\" DUTCH PHOTOGRAPHER ERWIN OLAF, CELEBRATED FOR DIVERSE AND STYLIZED WORK, DEAD AT 64 As a prominent member of what had long been the largest Communist party in the West, Napolitano had advocated positions that often veered from party orthodoxy. He sought dialogue with Italian and European socialists to end his party\u2019s isolation, and he was an early backer of European integration. Turin daily La Stampa once wrote of Napolitano: \"He was the least communist Communist that the party ever enlisted.\" In a condolence telegram to Napolitano's widow, Clio, Pope Francis said the late president \"showed great gifts of intellect and sincere passion for Italian political life as well as strong interest for the fates of nations.\" The pontiff, who is on a pilgrimage to France, noted he had had personal meetings with Napolitano, \"during which I appreciated his humanity and long-range vision in assuming with rectitude important choices, especially in delicate moments for the life of the country.\" During the first Gulf War, Napolitano broke with the position of the leader of the Italian Communist Party to oppose the withdrawal of Italy\u2019s tiny contingent. That amounted to a radical evolution for a Communist politician, who at the time of the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary had hailed the suppression as necessary. Ultimately, his political reputation was shaped by his reformist views. A former U.S. ambassador to Italy, Richard Gardner, in comments to The Associated Press in 2006, when Napolitano was first elected to be head of state, called him \"a true believer in democracy, a friend to the United States.\" As ambassador, Gardner had helped arrange secret meetings with Napolitano at a time when any public meeting would have been seen as embarrassing for Italian Communists as well as U.S. politicians.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Napolitano was among the staunchest supporters of his party\u2019s reform path, which would eventually lead to changing its name and dropping the hammer-and-sickle symbol. Premier Giorgia Meloni, whose far-right party is at the opposite end of the political spectrum of the late president, expressed condolences in the name of her government. Like many other future politicians of his generation, Napolitano fought against the Italian Fascists and Nazi occupiers during World War II. When the war ended, he joined the Communist Party, and in 1953, he was elected to Parliament, an office he would hold for 10 straight legislatures. In 1989, he went to the United States with the party secretary for the first-ever visit by a Italian Communist leader. While the presidential role is mostly ceremonial, the head of state can send Parliament packing sooner than its normal five-year term if it is hopelessly squabbling, a not-rare occurrence in Italy\u2019s long history of short-lived governments. The president also taps someone to attempt to form a new government and can reject some of the premier\u2019s Cabinet choices or refuse to sign legislation as a way to encourage Parliament to improve a law. Supposed to be above the political fray, Italy's president also can serve as a sort of moral compass for the country and a guardian of the values laid out in Italy's post-war Constitution. During his long career, Napolitano also served as speaker of Parliament\u2019s lower Chamber of Deputies and for five years as a lawmaker in the European Parliament. In 2005, his predecessor in the Quirinal palace, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, conferred on him one of Italy\u2019s greatest honors, making him a senator-for-life. A year later, Parliament would make him president of Italy, the first former Communist \u2014 and so far the only one \u2014 to serve as head of state. Admirers praised Napolitano\u2019s balanced attitude and gentlemanly ways. He was sometimes dubbed \"King Giorgio.\" But critics pointed to what they saw as excessive caution. Still, when at the end of his first, seven-year term as head of state, bickering lawmakers couldn\u2019t reach consensus on his successor, he broke with tradition and agreed to be elected to a second term \u2014 with the proviso that he wouldn\u2019t serve a full term due to advancing age. He was then 80. PETER C. NEWMAN, AUSTRIAN-BORN CANADIAN AUTHOR, JOURNALIST AND MEDIA FIGUREHEAD, DEAD AT 94 In April 2013, Napolitano pardoned a U.S. Air Force colonel convicted in an Italian trial based on the U.S. extraordinary rendition practice that had resulted in a Muslim cleric being abducted from a street in Milan in 2003 and hustled off to Egypt where he was tortured, before eventually being released. Napolitano said he granted the pardon in hopes of keeping U.S.-Italian relations strong, especially on security matters. The United States had considered the trial and convictions unprecedented because a U.S. military officer had been convicted for deeds committed on Italian territory. Napolitano resigned in January 2015, paving the way for Mattarella, a former Christian Democrat, to be elected. Mattarella would go on to be himself twice elected to the presidency, again after renewed political gridlock in Parliament thwarted the election of a fresh candidate in 2022.

There were 232,972 migrant encounters at the southern border in August, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced on Friday afternoon. That is an increase from the 204,087 encounters in August 2022, and an increase from the 183,494 encountered in July and the 144,570 encountered in June. It is the highest number of monthly encounters seen this year, although it is not the highest number seen this fiscal year -- with both November and December 2022 seeing higher numbers. Of those encounters in August, which is the highest August on record, 181,059 were encountered by Border Patrol illegally between ports of entry.&nbsp; DHS TO OFFER WORK PERMITS, DEPORTATION PROTECTION TO OVER 470,000 VENEZUELANS AMID NEW BORDER SURGE  \"CBP remains vigilant in the face of ruthless smugglers and transnational criminal organizations who exploit vulnerable migrants, the same criminal organizations trafficking in lethal drugs that harm our communities,\" acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said in a statement. \"Our operational tempo along the border has increased in response to increased encounters, and we remain squarely focused on our broader security mission and enforcing U.S. immigration laws.\" \"We are maximizing consequences against those without a legal basis to remain in the United States, including by processing more individuals into expedited removal than ever before. The men and women of CBP continue to work, day in and day out, to protect our nation, disrupting the entry of dangerous people and dangerous goods into the country while providing humanitarian care for vulnerable individuals,\" he said. The data brings the total migrant encounters for the fiscal year, excluding September, to over 2.2 million migrant encounters. CBP sources told Fox that, with September\u2019s numbers so far, encounters for FY 2023 have already surpassed FY 22\u2019s record 2.37 million encounters. Sources told Fox News on Friday that, with eight days left to go, there have been 2,388,350 encounters in FY 2023. May and June saw a drop in border encounters after the ending of Title 42. The Biden administration attributed the drop to the implementation of a number of policies, including expanded \"lawful\" migrant pathways, a new asylum rule limiting who could claim asylum and the restoration of Title 8 enforcement. But numbers have since shot up, engulfing the border in crisis again, and having knock-on effects in cities like New York City and Chicago -- where officials and residents have called on the federal government to do more to help them deal with the influx. There have been a daily average of around 9,000 encounters in recent days at the border. The surge was on display this week in Eagle Pass, Texas, where thousands of Venezuelan migrants surged into the area across the river, camping out under a nearby bridge -- which forced a temporary shutdown of two bridges as agents struggled to cope. The August numbers brought criticism from congressional Republicans, who criticized the administration for having tied the drop in encounters in June to its policies.

Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords for your social media accounts.&nbsp; A password manager will also help to keep track of all your passwords.&nbsp; Evaluate the source of the link before clicking it: if it is an unknown website or news source, be cautious. Scammers may use phishing links in DMs, emails, posts, or text messages to infect your device with malware or capture your login credentials.&nbsp; Be careful of anyone asking you for money: even if they claim to be a friend or family member. Scammers may use romance scams or impersonate someone you know to trick you into sending them money.&nbsp; Closely evaluate sensational claims: such as for a cure or treatment, a great prize or gift card, or a job offer that sounds too good to be true. Scammers may use these tactics to lure you into giving them your personal information or paying them a fee.&nbsp; Watch out for posts with poor spelling and grammatical mistakes: these may indicate that the post is not from a legitimate source.&nbsp; Watch out for sparse profiles: scammers often create sparse profiles to impersonate someone else or to lure you into giving them information. They may use a photo of a celebrity, a friend, or a stranger that they found online. They may also use a name that sounds familiar or appealing. However, if you look closely at their profile, you will notice that they have no other details or activity on their social media.&nbsp; Beware of friend requests from familiar faces with whom you are already connected: these requests may be from scammers who are trying to impersonate your real friends and trick you in some way. Before you accept any friend request, always check the profile and compare it with the one you already have.&nbsp; Limit what you share about yourself online: scammers may use your personal details, photos, and videos to create fake social media accounts and impersonate you. Scammers can also use this information to steal your identity or access your online accounts.&nbsp; Report fake social media accounts whenever you find them: if you suspect a fake account, report it to the social media platform and warn your friends about it. You can also block or unfriend people who send you suspicious messages or requests.&nbsp; MORE: WARNING OVER NEW FACEBOOK AND APPLE EMAIL SCAMS DUELING FOR YOUR ATTENTION&nbsp; If you suspect you're a victim of a social media scammer  If you suspect you\u2019re a victim of a social media scammer, you need to take urgent action immediately. Here are some immediate steps to take:&nbsp; Secure your account: Immediately change your password to lock potential hackers out. If you\u2019re locked out of your account, contact Facebook's support immediately to recover it.&nbsp; Inform your contacts: Alert friends and family so they're aware and won't be duped by messages or requests coming from your compromised account.&nbsp; Have strong antivirus protection on all your devices: The best way to protect yourself from having your data breached by social media scammers is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. Strong antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.&nbsp; See the best 2023 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android &amp; iOS devices.&nbsp; Monitor account activities: Keep an eye on your active sessions, messages sent, and any changes made to your account. Any unfamiliar activity should be reported and reversed.&nbsp; Seek expert help: If you believe your personal information, such as financial data or other sensitive details, has been compromised, consider reaching out to cyber security professionals or services that can guide you on further recovery and protection steps.&nbsp; Use identity theft protection: Social media scammers are constantly looking for ways to steal your personal info and use it for their own benefit. They may send you phishing emails, fake friend requests, or malicious links that can compromise your online security.&nbsp; Theft protection companies can monitor personal information like your home title, Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.&nbsp; They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.&nbsp; One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to 1 million dollars to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a US-based case manager helps you recover any losses.&nbsp; See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft&nbsp; Kurt's key takeaways  Just like any thriving city, our social media landscape is packed with shared laughs, precious memories, and, yes, an endless parade of cat videos.&nbsp; Let's not forget even the most charming city has its shady backstreets.

He also stood firm on his stance that Iran should not possess nuclear weapons. During his interview with Baier, MBS said Saudi Arabia would have to get its own nuclear weapon should Iran also possess one \"for security reasons. For the balance of power.\" \"I think Iran should be prevented in every possible manner from getting nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said.

So far the main topics addressed, with climate change, Russia's war in Ukraine and economic inflation, being the most pressing issues discussed.&nbsp; Here are some highlights of the leaders who spoke on Day 4: Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the U.N. General Assembly on Friday that Israel is \"at the cusp\" of a breakthrough in a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia. Using visual aids, he showed a map of Israel in 1948 \u2013 surrounded by multiple hostile Arab countries at the time.&nbsp; Fox News chief political anchor and \"Special Report\" anchor and executive editor Bret Baier sat down with Netanyahu on Friday to get his reaction to Baier's interview with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) Wednesday on \"Special Report.\" In the decades since, Israel has normalized relations with six of those nations, including four that did so in the 2020 Abraham Accords.&nbsp; \"There\u2019s no question the Abraham Accords heralded the dawn of a new age of peace. But I believe that we are at the cusp of an even more dramatic breakthrough, a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,\" Netanyahu said. \"Peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia will truly create a new Middle East.\"  Some hurdles remain in the sought peace agreement with Saudi Arabia, including the creation of a Palestinian state. In an interview with Baier earlier this week, MBS said both sides were getting closer to formal normalized relations.&nbsp; \"Every day we get closer, it seems it's for the first time real one serious. We get to see how it goes,\" the crown prince said.&nbsp; He insisted his country could work with Israel, no matter who is in charge, calling the deal \"the biggest historical deal since the end of the Cold War,\" which he stated would rest upon agreements related to the treatment of the Palestinians. \"If we have a breakthrough of reaching a deal that gives the Palestinians their needs and make the region calm, we're going to work with whoever is there,\" he added.&nbsp; Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down more than a decade ago. Violence has soared in recent years as Israel has carried out military raids in the occupied West Bank and Palestinians attacking Israelis.  On Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for Palestine to be admitted into the United Nations, like Israel.&nbsp; \"There are two states that the entire world is talking about: Israel and Palestine,\" Abbas told the General Assembly. \"But only Israel is recognized. Why not Palestine?\" \"What is the danger posed by the state of Palestine obtaining full membership of the United Nations?\" he added.&nbsp; Netanyahu also called for more sanctions against Iran, which Israel views as its biggest threat. The stepped-up sanctions request was over Iran's nuclear program, which has steadily progressed since the United States withdrew from the agreement. Pakistan Prime Minister&nbsp;Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, Prime Minister said the decades-long dispute with India over&nbsp;Kashmir and peace is the key to establishing development in the area.&nbsp; Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since British colonialists granted them independence in 1947 and both claim the region in its entirety. They have fought two wars over its control. \"Kashmir is the key to peace between Pakistan and India,\" Kakar said.&nbsp; He accused India of imposing lockdowns and curfews in the area, jailing Kashmiri leaders, violently suppressing peaceful protests and committing killings against Kashmiris.&nbsp;  A 1948 U.N. referendum gave Kashmir the choice of joining either Pakistan or India, creating a disputed region, but it never happened. The part of Kashmir controlled by India was granted semi-autonomy and special privileges in exchange for accepting Indian rule. Kashmiri dissidents launched a full-blown armed revolt in 1989, seeking unification with Pakistan or complete independence. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces were killed in the raging conflict. Iraq Iraqi&nbsp;Prime Minister Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani said combatting the \"corruption pandemic\" disease in his country is a top priority for his administration.&nbsp; \"We believe that there is a symbiotic relationship between corruption and terrorism,\" he said.&nbsp; Iraq has been plagued with violence as it struggles to combat terrorism. The U.N. Security Council voted last week&nbsp;to end, a year from now, a U.N. probe into the activities of Islamic State extremists in Iraq. The vote came at the request of the Iraqi government. The Security Council in September 2017 set up the investigative team \u2014 also at Iraq\u2019s request \u2014 to collect evidence against members of the Islamic State group to be used in trials.  In August, Iraq and Iran reached an agreement that \"armed terrorist groups\" in Iraq's Kurdistan region will be disarmed and relocated next month. Al-Sudani also said Iraq was still in talks with the&nbsp;&nbsp;Kurdistan Region. He said Iraq wants \"to expand opportunities with the Kurdistan Region and lead to more productivity in all fields Haiti Haiti is in the midst of a deteriorating security breakdown as criminal gangs control parts of the country through assassinations, kidnappings and sex crimes, Prime Minister Ariel Henry said.&nbsp; Gang violence has surged in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas in recent months, with 1,860 people reported killed, injured or kidnapped from April to June, a 14% increase compared with the first three months of the year, according to the latest U.N. statistics. \"It has not reached a critical point,\" Henry said. \"They assassinate. They set fires. They pillage, steal and abuse with particular cruelty. They drive citizens from their homes. They block roads and they force schools and hospitals, as well as businesses, to close their doors.\"  Gangs are now estimated to control up to 80% of Port-au-Prince and have grown more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse. Nearly 200,000 Haitians have been forced to flee their homes as gangs pillage communities and rape and kill people living in areas controlled by rival gangs, a tenfold increase in the past two years, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \"We are here to ask our friendly countries to understand that there is something urgent to be done to benefit the people of Haiti and to help us create a better future for the children of Haiti by re-establishing security and stability,\" Henry said.&nbsp; More than 20,000 displaced Haitians are living in crumbling and unhygienic shelters where gangs prey on young children and try to recruit them. On Friday, the Biden administration pledged $100 million to support a proposed Kenyan-led multinational force to restore security to conflict-ravaged Haiti and urged other nations to make similar contributions.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Haiti shares an island with the Dominican Republic, which has voiced concerns over violence potentially spilling over into its borders.&nbsp; \"What is happening in Haiti is a breakdown of public order by criminal elements, without any political or ideological claim,\" Dominican President Luis Abinader told the General Assembly on Tuesday. \"So, to accept the Haitian authorities' request for help by sending a multinational force is in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the United Nations Charter and the mandate of this organization in accordance with international law, to guarantee peace.\" United Kingdom Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence and called for greater regulation of the technology.&nbsp; \"We are fast becoming familiar with the AI of today, but we need to prepare for the AI of tomorrow,\" he said. \"At this frontier, we need to accept that we simply don't know the bounds of possibilities. We are as (Thomas) Edison before the lights came on.\" While AI \u2013 a branch of computer science that is designed to understand and store human intelligence, mimic human capabilities, including the completion of tasks, process human language and perform speech recognition \u2013 has the potential to empower the masses, it can also be used \"for ill,\" Dowden said.&nbsp;  He cited criminals using the technology using AI to hack into bank accounts, terrorists who target government systems and cybercriminals fooling voters with deepfakes and bots.&nbsp; \"Many argue that this technology is like no other in the sense that its creators themselves don't even know how it works,\" said Dowden. \"They can't explain why it does what it does. And they cannot predict what it will or will not do.\" The main risks of AI will therefore come from \"misuse, misadventure or misalignment with human objectives,\" he said.&nbsp; An internet watchdog group recently sounded the alarm over the growing trend of sex offenders collaborating online to use open-source artificial intelligence to generate child sexual abuse material. Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) found that offenders are increasingly turning to AI to create illegal child sexual abuse material and distribute it online.  Dowden also condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, \"an attack on a sovereign member of the United Nations by a permanent member of its Security Council,\" he said. He called Moscow's military aggression the \"most heinous assault imaginable on everything this organization stands for and was founded to prevent.\" \"Russia could end this war tomorrow,\" Dowden said. \"That is what the world demands.\" Until that happens, the United Kingdom will stand alongside Ukraine \"for weeks, for months, if necessary, for years,\" he said.&nbsp; Australia Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong focused on world conflict and called on the U.N. to better respond to \"age of existential threats.\" She also called for constraints on how the veto is used, referring to Russia, one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. Moscow is able to use its veto power that some have said keeps the U.N. deadlocked as debate rages about its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp; \"With its special responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia mocks the United Nations&nbsp;every day it continues its illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine,\" Wong said.  \"Just as Russia mocks the international community with its cynical games on food security that leave millions hungry; promising grain to vulnerable nations yet at the same time destroying Ukrainian grain silos along the Black Sea Coast,\" she added.&nbsp; Wong also spoke of tensions in the South China Sea, China's military build-up in the region and North Korea's nuclear ambitions.&nbsp; \"When you add dangerous encounters in the air and at sea, including between nuclear powers, we are faced with a combination of factors that give rise to the most confronting circumstances in decades,\"&nbsp;she told the General Assembly.  \"In short, military power is expanding, but measures to constrain military conflict are not \u2013 and there are few concrete mechanisms for averting it The Associated Press contributed to this report.&nbsp;", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T14:54:32-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Matt-Canada.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 star urges Steelers to fire offensive coordinator Matt Canada: \u2018Get the f\u2014 out of Pittsburgh\u2019", "content": "A frustrated Pittsburgh Steelers fan used an unorthodox method to air out his frustrations with the franchise, which has now gone viral.&nbsp; Dean Norris, the \"Breaking Bad\" star who played Officer Hank Schrader on the hit TV show, was hired by the fan via Cameo to record himself sending a message to the team\u2019s offensive coordinator, Matt Canada.&nbsp; The message from the fan was succinct with some expletives.

Keeping your email safe  Your email inbox is a hacker\u2019s paradise. They can use your email to reset your passwords and, deny you access to your accounts, and send scam messages to your contacts. Simply, they take your key and lock you out of your own house. Keeping your email safe not only protects you but also those around you from potential harm.&nbsp;&nbsp; One way to help keep your email safe is by setting up an alias email. This is a forwarding email address that does not have its own inbox, login, or the ability to send messages. All emails it receives go into your primary email\u2019s inbox without you having to reveal your actual account. This helps prevent scammers from getting a hold of your real address and using it for malicious activity.&nbsp; In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.&nbsp; Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.&nbsp; TEN TELLTALE SIGNS THAT SOMEONE HAS STOLEN YOUR IDENTITY See my review of best secure and private email services&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.

Kennedy Jr. took direct aim at President Joe Biden\u2019s immigration policies in a new op-ed, calling them a disaster. Writing in Newsweek, Kennedy ripped the Biden administration for \"refusing to secure our southern border\" which has led to \"endless floods of migrants pouring through an open border\" and \"impossible burdens\" for American cities. He wrote, \"According to [New York City Mayo Eric] Adams, the status quo of 110,000 migrant arrivals in just the last year is utterly unsustainable and threatens to \u2018destroy the city.\u2019 To address the financial impact of the crisis, which he estimates could cost $12 billion by 2025, he directed city agencies to cut 5 percent from spending by November.\" AOC SKEWERS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES: HIS 'WEAKEST ISSUE'  The candidate mentioned several other cities facing the same issues as New York City, stating, \"Cities across the U.S. are experiencing crises in social services and severe budget shortfalls because of the unprecedented migrant influx. Chicago is facing a $538 million budget shortfall for 2024 with more than a third of that shortfall resulting from the migrant crisis, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\" Kennedy Jr. laid this situation at the feet of President Biden, writing, \"Clearly, the migrant crisis resulting from the Biden administration's refusal to secure our southern border has created impossible burdens for municipalities across the country.\" \"The idea of sanctuary cities was to protect immigrants from ICE raids. But no city can manage endless floods of migrants pouring through an open border,\" he declared. No country can sustain nearly two million migrants a year, Kennedy wrote. It's one of several stances Kennedy has taken that puts him at odds with the establishment of his own party. In fact, polls show him far more popular with Republicans than Democrats, but the scion of the famous political family hasn't signaled he'll switch parties. WHITE HOUSE INSISTS THERE'S 'NO SIGN' ISIS SYMPATHIZER'S SMUGGLING RING BROUGHT TERRORISTS INTO US Imploring the country to see Biden\u2019s \"charade\", he stated, \"I call upon all Americans, of every party and political persuasion, to face facts. President Biden's loose border policy has been a disaster. Under Biden, it's easier for migrants to enter illegally than legally. His policy is tantamount to \u2018narrow gate, no fence.\u2019\" Kennedy Jr. called this a \"de facto open border policy\" that has resulted in \"a humanitarian crisis of unimaginable proportions.\" He added, \"It isn't only border communities that have been caught in the crossfire. Civil disorder is encroaching into the interior of the U.S. as destitute migrants flood American cities, overwhelming humanitarian resources.\" In a parting shot to the current administration, he concluded, \"Current policies are failing our country and putting an intolerable strain on American cities that have already faced unprecedented challenges in the last three years.

BOB MENENDEZ STEPS DOWN 'TEMPORARILY' AS CHAIRMAN OF SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE You know, this was a partisan prosecution because the Southern District of New York indicted \"Golden Bar Bob\", not the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Or was Menendez just a thorn in Biden's side? Because remember, the Obama-Biden Justice Department indicted Menendez on bribery, but he skated on a hung jury.&nbsp; Now, it makes sense when you realize Menendez doesn't want to open Cuba, Biden does. Menendez hates the Iran deal, Biden wants back in. Menendez loves Israel, Biden not so much. Menendez was dead set against Venezuelan amnesty, and Biden just gave half a million Venezuelan Social Security numbers.&nbsp;  So Menendez is cooked, and President Biden has a wider lane in foreign affairs now. But we're getting to know Joe Biden aren't we? He sees an obstacle, and he doesn't move around it, he removes it. Trump indicted. Menendez indicted. Mini-Madoff took the money, indicted. Elon Musk investigated four times; the indictment is coming. You're unvaxxed, you're fired. Biden's cagier than we give him credit for. He did exactly what Bob Menendez did, but every time investigators got close, they were obstructed. Hunter was tipped off and the CIA and the FBI covered for him.&nbsp;  Think about it. The Bidens were getting bribed with diamonds. The Menendez's were getting bribed with gold bars. The Bidens were getting paid in Porsche's. The Menendez's were getting paid in Benz's. The Bidens were getting no show jobs. The Menendez's were getting no show jobs. The Bidens were going to business dinners with foreign clients. The Menendez's were going to business dinners with foreign clients. The Bidens took the cash and wire transfers though, the Menendez's took the cash in cash. The Bidens hid the bribes and shell companies. The Menendez's hid the bribes in their windbreakers. They both tried swapping in a new prosecutor. They both used foreign aid to squeeze cash out of countries. They both used encrypted apps to conduct the conspiracy. Same result, selling out the country for personal profit. Even the charge would be the same conspiring to abuse an official position and inducing payments from it. So what's the difference between a Menendez and a Biden?

It's embarrassing for the country. His cognitive struggles might actually be the least of his problems. We've got a new poll showing that nearly half of you, the American people, support the impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden. They believe that Biden is corrupt and he should be held accountable. Meanwhile, Biden and Trump, well, they're beyond a dead heat. Trump now winning in most polls. CBS poll even has Trump at the 50% threshold. That's a big number. Voters are now giving Biden low marks for the economy. Inflation and his age is obviously a massive concern among the American people, who are also rightly appalled at Biden's border crisis, you know, which has been critical from day one, even though they say all the borders closed.

King Charles' celebration  King Charles and Queen Camilla arrived in France Wednesday for a three-day diplomatic visit. The trip started with a celebratory welcome dinner at the Palace of Versailles with 150 guests, including Hugh Grant and Mick Jagger.

The ability for Buffs fans to look back at those once glory days and project those into the future, it doesn\u2019t seem like a wish to hope and a dream anymore. It seems like a reality.\"&nbsp; Sanders took a good amount of criticism in the offseason for the way he transformed the roster at Colorado, with the Buffaloes returning just 10 scholarship players from 2022 and 68 new scholarship players on the roster, according to The Athletic.&nbsp; Sanders benefited from an NCAA rule that allows first-year head coaches to cut players, though the university must honor the players' scholarships.&nbsp; \"The Buffs were 1-11 last year, one of the worst teams in college football, and have been for several years.

So, I see both sides. \u2018Coach Prime\u2019 was tasked with turning the Buffaloes into what they are now \u2013 part of the national conversation and a team that will hopefully be a part of the College Football Playoff.

While I think that is ridiculous, to a 19 or 17-year-old, that certainly is selling worthy and recruiting worthy of the kind of dollars that are flowing into the program, the NIL opportunities which are now a part of college football.\" While the Colorado hype train is moving at a lightning-fast pace, it almost came to a screeching halt in Week 3, and the schedule now turns incredibly tough as Pac-12 play arrives.&nbsp; The Buffaloes needed a 98-yard drive and a two-point conversion in order to beat Colorado State in double overtime last week, while two matchups against top-10 teams are next up on the schedule.&nbsp; \"The Colorado State game showed some chinks in the armor,\" Brown said.&nbsp;  No. 19 Colorado will be without two-way star Travis Hunter against Oregon after he was sent to the hospital following a late hit by Colorado State safety Henry Blackburn.&nbsp; OREGON'S DAN LANNING HAS NO REGRETS OVER COLORADO JAB, SAYS WASN'T AIMED AT CURRENT TEAM OR DEION SANDERS \"The Colorado State game also exposed the flaws on the offensive and defensive lines, where they\u2019re not quite big and physical enough, and they\u2019re certainly not fast enough,\" Brown told Fox News Digital. \"For Oregon, which has been a program that's been a top 10, top 15 program for quite a while now, for USC with a Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback, the Buffs will be tested in ways that they haven't.&nbsp; \"Do I believe they'll play hard?

That same year, Swift was a guest on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show,\" and she shared that the Jonas Brothers star dumped her in a 25-second phone call.  \"He broke up with you on the phone? That\u2019s not right,\" DeGeneres told Swift at the time. \"It\u2019s all right \u2013 I\u2019m cool,\" Swift responded. \"You know what, it\u2019s like, when I find that person that is right for me, he\u2019ll be wonderful.

In re-examining the results of a previous study, the U.K. researchers determined that one-third of the youth with gender dysphoria (GD) experienced a decline in mental health after taking triptorelin. Sold under the brand name Trelstar, triptorelin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that reduces the amount of certain hormones in the body. EXPOSING THE TRANS AGENDA AIMED AT OUR KIDS: FAITH LEADER REVEALS HOW PARENTS CAN KEEP CHILDREN SAFE The original study, which came from NHS's Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at Tavistock and University College London Hospitals (UCLH) in 2021, analyzed 44 children between the ages of 12 and 15 who took puberty-blocking drugs.  The children were all deemed \"psychologically stable,\" but all of them had been classified as having gender dysphoria, with a \"high likelihood of extreme psychological distress with ongoing pubertal development,\" the study authors wrote in the journal entry discussing the findings. At the time, the researchers determined that the drugs had no impact on the kids\u2019 mental health over a 36-month follow-up period. SURFER BETHANY HAMILTON SPEAKS OUT AGAINST NEW RULE ALLOWING TRANSGENDER WOMEN TO COMPETE WITH FEMALES The new analysis of the study, however, determined that 34% of the trans youth experienced a decline in mental health while taking puberty blockers. At the same time, 37% reported no change in mental health and 29% noticed an improvement. To determine the extent of mental health changes, the researchers looked at emotional factors (anxiety, depression, social withdrawals and somatic complaints) as well as behavioral signals, such as attention problems and aggressive behaviors, according to the researchers. They also analyzed sleep difficulties.  While the original study combined the overall average of all kids\u2019 mental well-being, the new analysis looked at each child\u2019s individual psychological health, which revealed more variation among them. \"This is the first analysis of U.K. data on children aged 12 to 15 with GD taking puberty blockers demonstrating individual level change as opposed to testing differences between group averages,\" the study authors wrote in a journal entry describing the findings. \"As such, this analysis gives a fuller picture of the benefits and risks of treatment.\" The new analysis determined that 34% of the trans youth experienced a decline in mental health while taking puberty blockers. \"We recommend that these approaches be incorporated into new gender dysphoria services being established in the U.K., as well as new research studies being designed,\" they added. The new analysis was posted to medRxiv, a preprint service for health studies, but has not yet been peer-reviewed. KIDS NEED TO BE KIDS IN AMERICA, SAID ORLANDO CAB DRIVER TROUBLED BY THE TRANS AGENDA The study did have some limitations. It included a small sample size of youth and there was no control group. There was also a limited dataset available for the children who were studied. Also, the results show association but not necessarily causation, as there may have been other factors that could have affected the children\u2019s mental health.  A spokesperson from Tavistock and Portman Trust, which conducted the original study, provided the following statement to the Daily Mail: \"We are grateful to all of the clinicians and academics who have contributed to this study over the years, and we welcome new peer-reviewed analyses of the evidence around how to support these young people.\" NEW UN-BACKED LEGAL RECOMMENDATIONS NORMALIZE SEX WITH MINORS, OUTRAGED CRITICS SAY \"The analysis plan for the original study was independently produced by experts in medical statistics, and the underlying data was published so that other researchers might conduct further analyses.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to Tavistock and Portman Trust for further comment. Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon and longevity expert, was not involved in either of the studies, but shared with Fox News Digital that he was not surprised by the impact of puberty blockers on kids\u2019 mental health.  \"The human brain \u2014 and in particular the developing brain \u2014 is particularly sensitive to and reliant on circulating hormone levels to function optimally,\" said Osborn. Sex hormones like testosterone, estrogen, and progesterone \u2014 the ones that were suppressed in the study population using triptorelin \u2014 also play a major role in mood regulation and cognition, the doctor noted. \"Not only our bodies, but our brains, function best with optimal hormone levels.\" \"Optimal progesterone levels are also important for sleep, whereas low levels are associated with insomnia and mood lability (mood swings),\" Osborn said. Additionally, estrogen levels affect neurotransmitters in the mood centers of the brain, thus impacting emotional experiences, the doctor noted. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Estrogen also plays a central role in cognition and our sense of general well-being \u2014 for both men and women,\" Osborn said. \"Men and women need progesterone and estrogen for optimal brain development and function.\" Testosterone is also largely responsible for mood and well-being, the doctor went on \u2014 and a lack of it can lead to fatigue, irritability and poor sleep hygiene.

Not only our bodies, but our brains, function best with optimal hormone levels,\" Osborn concluded.&nbsp; \"Lowering their levels artificially with medications like triptorelin is potentially dangerous and only contributing to the escalating mental health burden in America.\" For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews/health.&nbsp;", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T05:30:42-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/11/931/523/Newsom-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Newsom vetoes bill that would require parents to affirm child\u2019s gender identity in custody battles", "content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, vetoed a bill late Friday night that would have required judges in child custody cases to consider whether a parent has affirmed their child's gender identity. AB 957 originally proposed that courts deciding custody cases must consider whether each parent affirmed the child's gender identity. An amendment in June added a parent's affirmation of their child's gender identity to the state's standard of what constitutes parental responsibility in a court of law for providing for \"the health, safety, and welfare of the child.\" The bill was passed earlier this month by the state assembly, and was sent to the governor's desk for his signature. But Newsom said in a statement released Friday night that he cannot sign the legislation.&nbsp; The governor said he appreciates the \"passion and values\" that led Democrat Assemblywoman Lori Wilson to introduce the bill and that he shares a \"deep commitment to advancing the rights of transgender Californians, an effort that has guided my decisions through many decades in public office.\" CALIFORNIA PASSES BILL PUNISHING PARENTS WHO DON'T \u2018AFFIRM\u2019 TRANS KIDS IN CUSTODY BATTLES: \u2018UTTER MADNESS!'  \"That said, I urge caution when the Executive and Legislative branches of state government attempt to dictate -in prescriptive terms that single out one characteristic -legal standards for the Judicial branch to apply,\" Newsom wrote. \"Other-minded elected officials, in California and other states, could very well use this strategy to diminish the civil rights of vulnerable communities.\" \"Moreover, a court, under existing law, is required to consider a child's health, safety, and welfare when determining the best interests of a child in these proceedings, including the parent's affirmation of the child's gender identity,\" he added. When parents divorce and cannot agree on child custody, judges will determine custody based on a variety of factors. Under AB 957, gender affirmation would have been one of the several factors for judges to consider in custody cases. Wilson, who coauthored the bill along with Democrat state Sen. Scott Wiener, has said the bill would not have required parents to move forward with gender transition medical treatment. \"I am extremely disappointed. I know the Governor's record. He's been a champion for the LGBTQ+ community for years and even before it was popular to do so,\" Wilson said in a statement after the governor's veto on Friday. \"However, on this point, the Governor and I disagree on the best way to protect [Transgender, Gender-Diverse and Intersex]&nbsp;kids.\" NEWLY AMENDED CALIFORNIA BILL COULD PUNISH PARENTS REFUSING TO \u2018AFFIRM\u2019 CHILD'S GENDER IDENTITY  Wilson said she has been \"disheartened\" over the last few years as she \"watched the rising hate and heard the vitriol towards the trans community.\"&nbsp; \"My intent with this bill was to give them a voice, particularly in the family court system where a non-affirming parent could have a detrimental impact on the mental health and well-being of a child,\" she said. \"Whether the roadblock comes from the opposition or even a supporter, it only hardens my resolve. I'm far from done, this fight is personal! Not just for my family, but to all the trans kids that deserve a brighter and safer future.\" Wiener wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that Newsom's veto is \"a tragedy for trans kids here &amp; around the country. These kids are living in fear, with right wing politicians working to out them, deny them health care, ban them from sports &amp; restrooms &amp; erase their humanity. CA needs to unequivocally stand with these kids.\" The senator said the \"level of right wing misinformation\" about the bill was \"astounding\" and that \"all the bill did was ensure that in custody disputes, a court would take into account the kid\u2019s gender identity &amp; whether parents would be supportive of the kid as opposed to tormenting the kid.\"&nbsp; \"Governor Newsom has been such a staunch ally to the LGBTQ community. A true champion. Respectfully, however, this veto is a mistake,\" Wiener wrote.  Earlier this month, Wilson said on the assembly floor that parents \"affirm their children, they have since the dawn of time.\" \"Typically, it happens when their gender identity matches their biological gender. But what happens is, when it doesn't, that\u2019s when the affirmation starts to wane,\" she said at the time, later arguing that \"our duty as parents is to affirm our children.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a statement released after the bill passed the assembly on September 8, Wilson said, \"The California Family Code is intended to center the best interest of the child in all decisions about visitation and custody. However, the Family Code currently fails to take into account this very vulnerable population of TGI children who are at increased risk of family rejection.\"&nbsp; She added, \"LGBTQ+ youth learn to value and care about themselves when they are valued by their parents and family. The TGI Youth Empowerment Act will provide affirming parents the support they need from family court to continue to love and affirm their diverse TGI children.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T05:34:12-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/portland-bike-squad-curve-half-left-thumbnail.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "\u2018Fentanyl nexus\u2019: Portland police\u2019s bike squad faces \u2018explosion\u2019 of open-air drug use", "content": "Wheels squeal as officer David Baer wrenches his bike to the right and jumps it onto the sidewalk next to a Subaru.

You'll be out of here in a second,\" Baer tells the driver before walking back to his bicycle. WATCH: AN AFTERNOON WITH PORTLAND'S BICYCLE OFFICERS:  WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE Public drinking was the main infraction Baer encountered when he joined the Portland Police Bureau's bike squad four years ago. But since Oregon voters decriminalized personal-use amounts of all drugs in 2020, he said there has been an \"explosion\" in open-air drug use. \"All roads in downtown lead to fentanyl,\" Baer told Fox News. \"Whether that's stolen cars, whether that's burglaries or thefts or organized retail theft, there's almost always a fentanyl nexus. So we spend a lot of our time currently policing fentanyl and trying to stop that flow.\" The Subaru driver's friend chats amicably with Baer as he writes a $100 ticket for drug possession. Baer warns her that, if they see him driving her car without a license, they'll tow it.  \"If I can see fentanyl from the sidewalk, it's a problem,\" Baer says.&nbsp; \"I get it, I get it,\" she responds. \"Okay. Just so you know.\" Then he gives the man his ticket and tells him to call the number on it if he wants treatment \u2014 or just doesn't want to have to pay the fine. \"I'm seizing your drugs as evidence,\" he says. \"Have a great day.\"  METH PIPE VALENTINES? HARM REDUCTION ADVOCATES, CRITICS AT ODDS OVER BEST WAY TO HELP DRUG USERS Throughout the afternoon, the squad arrests a couple of people with outstanding warrants.

Baer prods a man slumped over on an overturned bucket, asking repeatedly if he's okay before getting a response from one of the people sitting on the sidewalk nearby. A chain link fence separating the camp from the adjacent building is garnished with shirts and pants, like a makeshift clothesline. \"To see this happen in the city is just absolutely crushing,\" said Sgt. Jerry Cioeta, a Portland native who has worked as a cop in the city for 25 years. Homelessness and drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in recent years. Critics blame much of the problem on permissive laws, and both the city and state have made small reversals. Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek recently signed a bill making possession of more than 1 gram of fentanyl a misdemeanor. The Portland City Council outlawed camping on public property during the day, but hasn't begun enforcing the ordinance. Even more recently, city leaders voted unanimously to ban public drug use, but the ordinance can't take effect unless state law changes.  RIOTS CAUSED 'GENERATIONAL DAMAGE' TO POLICE DISCOURSE, BUT UNION PRESIDENT SEES IMPROVEMENT IN THIS CITY One area that appears to have changed more dramatically is the public's attitudes toward police. \"Bike squad!\" bystanders shout as the officers roll by in their bright yellow jackets. Business owners, residents and even some of the people being cited for drug use thank the officers for being there. \"It's super positive from the business community and even, for the most part, from just the people we're arresting,\" Cioeta said. He and Baer credit the bikes with making them more accessible. \"We're a part of the community because there's nowhere to go, right? When you're on a bike, you're exposed to everything,\" Baer said. \"People can interact with you. You're available. You can hear and smell and see everything that goes on on the streets.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP&nbsp; It's a much different environment than two or three summers ago when the sight of an officer in Portland was more likely to be met with hurled insults, and messages like \"kill all cops\" were scrawled in spray paint on buildings.

Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters, who was previously a public school teacher, claimed late Wednesday the Chinese government-backed Confucius Institutes are exerting undue influence on some schools, including within his home state. Confucius Institutes via Confucius Classrooms \u2013 billed as Chinese language and cultural organizations and named for the 6th Century-BC philosopher \u2013 are engaging in subversion of American values, Walters said in separate interviews with FOX News Digital and \"America's Newsroom.\" \"What we have found is the [Chinese Communist Party] has funded the Confucius Classrooms inside American schools, which, by their own words, is a propaganda campaign of a soft power attempt to undermine the American Constitution and American values. We're taking steps to end this in Oklahoma,\" he told \"America's Newsroom\" Wednesday.  Walters called for congressional action to blunt the influence of such programs, which he warned amount to a national security risk. He further accused Tulsa Public Schools, the state's largest district, of engaging with Confucius Classroom programs, and doing so indirectly through an intermediate organization. According to an August investigation by Tulsa's FOX affiliate KOKI, the Tulsa school board approved such an initiative through a Texas-based professional development organization. School officials told the outlet that resources as well as the salaries of teachers involved in the program were paid by the school district, not any outside entity. \"Students benefiting from our teacher's supplementary professional development with the International Leadership of Texas have achieved high honors in the past year, including placing in the Oklahoma Chinese Speech competition and the National Chinese Speech Contest,\" school officials told the outlet. The district has repeatedly denied it received any funds from Beijing. In a statement to \"America's Newsroom,\" Tulsa Public Schools said in-part the district \"has no Confucius classroom programs in its schools.\" In a report from \"The Oklahoman,\" the district reportedly funded a professional development class for a Chinese language teacher a one high school, which was facilitated through a Confucius Classroom Coordination Office at an outside, Texas-based organization. HALEY TARGETS CONFUCIUS INSTITUTES, BUT AT LEAST 2 OPERATED IN SC WHILE SHE WAS GOVERNOR In another statement to Tulsa's CBS affiliate, Tulsa Public Schools said Walters has wrongly focused on a \"Chinese language professional-development program for a single teacher\" and that the development offering is via an organization that partners with Confucius Classroom. \"The teacher\u2019s salary and adopted instructional resources are fully paid for by Tulsa Public Schools. Contrary to Superintendent Walters\u2019 accusations, the district takes no funds from the Chinese government,\" the statement continued, adding students have achieved high marks in Chinese speech competitions thanks to the offering. But Walters contends Chinese influence in places like Tulsa are much more concerning than other officials let on, claiming Tulsa school officials are not being completely forthright. \"The reality is we have their contract that they signed with the CCP-affiliated group, which talks about a financial agreement and a financial exchange,\" Walters said.&nbsp; He provided the contract to FOX News Digital, the first part of which was in Chinese text and the second in English. The contract was billed as an agreement between the Confucius Classroom Coordination Office ad the International Leadership of Texas Global and Tulsa Public Schools, \"on the establishment of the Confucius Classroom at Booker T. Washington High School.\" UNIVERSITY CUTS TIES WITH CONFUCIUS INSTITUTES AMID GOP SCRUTINY ON $17M DOD GRANT  The contract stated the Confucius Classroom at Booker T. Washington \"shall be a non-profit institution with the purpose of enhancing understanding and friendship between the young people of China and the United States by sponsoring the teaching and learning of the Chinese language and culture.\" It stated the school may conduct Chinese language and culture programs and proficiency tests, organize exchange programs and conduct cultural activities. \"The reality is we have their contract that they signed with the CCP-affiliated group, which talks about a financial agreement and a financial exchange,\" Walters said in regard to the contract. \"And that's why you see us continuing to push for not only in our state, requiring all districts to not only provide transparency of any dollar that comes from a foreign government, but also the dollars that come from their nonprofits because they have set up this apparatus that makes it very difficult to see how much money was exchanged\u2026\" Walters also expressed concern that such programs may or already do lead to data collection by groups linked to foreign adversaries, adding he has seen many organizations trying to collect student data, which he characterized as a cybersecurity and national security threat to the homeland. Walters said he has seen evidence of censorship overall in such programs, alleging reticence to discuss Taiwan or the Tiananmen Square protests. He said American public schools should continue to be open to engaging with organizations aligned with allies like Great Britain, Canada and Germany, and dismissed claims from the left that his objections are rooted in racism against other cultures. When asked about such allegations by House Early Childhood Education Subcommittee Chairman Aaron Bean, R-Fla., Walters testified, \"I completely reject that notion.\" CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  He also told FOX News that he was outraged by other critiques from Democrats in the hearing, claiming they tried to compare concerns over Confucius Classroom initiatives with influence from oil companies and advocacy group PragerU \u2013 co-founded by right-wing radio host Dennis Prager. During the hearing, Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., asked about PragerU's new partnership with Oklahoma, saying the organization has received funds from fossil fuel companies. \"It was outrageous to listen to Democrats compare a domestic threat as identified by our own national security, Communist China, to oil and gas companies and Prager U,\" Walters told FOX News Digital, emphasizing oil companies' positive impact on the economy. Walters said the CCP does not want American children to have a quality education, and are not concerned about cultural learning or any other stated goals. \"That's not why China is\u2026 investing programs in the country\u2026 They told us why they're investing \u2013 absolutely [in] a propaganda campaign to undermine American values.\" FOX News Digital reached out to Tulsa Public Schools for additional comment but did not receive a response.

Kilmeade noted the irony of Friday's indictment and said it proves Menendez is a hypocrite. \"He might be very much compromised to Egypt and benefiting financially with using diplomatic aid.

The second GOP presidential primary debate will be held Wednesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. And two days later, some of the top contenders for the Republican nomination will address the California GOP's fall 2023 convention in Anaheim. While modern-day California is a heavily blue-shaded state, Republicans once thrived in statewide contests. The GOP carried California \u2014 which for six decades has been the nation's most populous state \u2014 in every presidential election but one from 1952 through 1988. FIRST ON FOX: THE RNC RAISES THE BAR FOR THE CANDIDATES TO MAKE THE STAGE AT THE THIRD PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE  But Democrats have captured the state's large cache of electoral votes in every presidential election the past three decades, and have topped 60% of the vote in the past four White House contests. It's a similar story in Senate elections, with incumbent Pete Wilson's 1988 re-election the last time a Republican won a Senate contest in California. WATCH: MODERATORS PERINO, VARNEY PREVIEW WEDNESDAY'S DEBATE Republicans used to dominate gubernatorial elections in the Golden State \u2014 with Ronald Reagan, George Deukmejian, Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger each winning two terms over the past six decades. But Schwarzenegger's 2006 re-election was the last time a Republican won the governorship or any other statewide executive office in California. \"It\u2019s been decades since it\u2019s been a red state,\"&nbsp;Jack Pitney, a political science professor at California's Claremont McKenna College, noted.  Pitney says the Democratic political surge in the state the past half century is due to \"a combination of things \u2014 economics, demographics, Prop 187.\" \"The end of the Cold War meant the defense industry downsized,\" Pitney spotlighted. \"The defense industry was always a bulwark in California of the Republican Party.\" He also said that, to a degree, Prop 187 shifted the states growing Hispanic population towards the Democratic Party. The California ballot proposition, which passed in 1994, established a state-run citizenship screening system and prohibited illegal immigrants from using non-emergency health care, public education and other state services. Next year's high-profile Senate election in the race to succeed longtime Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein is further evidence, Pitney argued, that the California GOP \u2014 which produced two presidents and four governors during a half-century span \u2014 \"barely exists\" anymore at a statewide level.  While three well-known Democratic House members are running for the Senate, no major Republicans have entered the race.

According to an invitation for the \"intimate dinner and discussion,\" Golden State Warriors part-owner Chamath Palihapitiya and his wife Nathalie, along with a number of other individuals, will host Ramaswamy at their home in the San Francisco Bay Area on Sep. 29. The event invitation was first reported by Puck News. The cost to attend the event is a minimum $50,000 donation to Ramaswamy's American Exceptionalism PAC. RAMASWAMY UNVEILS PLAN TO 'DECLARE ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE FROM CHINA' IN UPCOMING POLICY SPEECH  Palihapitiya, a billionaire venture capitalist, made headlines last year when he claimed that \"nobody cares\" about the Chinese Communist Party-sponsored (CCP) genocide that has been recognized as such by several national governments. \"Let\u2019s be honest: nobody cares about what\u2019s happening to the Uyghurs, OK?\" Palihapitiya said on a Jan. 2022 episode of his podcast. \"You bring it up because you care, and I think that it\u2019s nice that you care.\" \"The rest of us don\u2019t care,\" Palihapitiya said about the ongoing genocide that has reportedly included forced sterilization, beatings and \"mental torture and physical torture.\" He said it was a \"very hard, ugly truth.\" KARI LAKE BOOSTS NATIONAL PROFILE AS TOP TRUMP SURROGATE, GOP CAMPAIGNER AHEAD OF LIKELY SENATE RUN  \"Of all the things I care about, yes, it is below my line,\" he continued, repeating that the communist state-sponsored Uyghur genocide was \"below\" his caring \"line.\" A campaign spokesperson told Fox News Digital that Ramaswamy vehemently disagrees with Palihapitiya on the Uyghur genocide, but will still attend the super PAC fundraiser. \"He thinks what's happening to the Uyghurs in China is an atrocity,\" Ramaswamy campaign communications director Tricia McLaughlin said. During a speech in Columbus, Ohio, Thursday where Ramaswamy laid out his plan to declare economic independence from China, he called the enslavement, imprisonment and forced sterilization of Uyghurs \"one of the worst human rights atrocities committed by a major nation since the Third Reich of Germany.\"  Noting that he is by far the biggest contributor to his own campaign, a McLaughlin added that Ramaswamy believes super PACs and dark money should not be part of the political system in America. \"Vivek thinks money corrupts politics. He's felt very strongly on that since day one, and if he is the GOP nominee he would like to strike a deal with the Democratic nominee to make sure there's no super PAC money in the race.

Stephanie Winn, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Portland, Oregon, started a meme campaign about a fictional subgroup of kids who identify as birds, likening discrimination they face to the debates over medical intervention for gender-confused minors, parental rights and mental health issues among transgender youth. Her satirical comparisons have garnered hundreds of thousands of viewers and captured the attention of prominent figures like Jordan Peterson and Elon Musk.&nbsp; The first meme of the series shows a young child wearing cardboard wings on his back and includes the text: \"Cardboard wings are wings. Let bird kids fly.\" Winn jokingly advocates for adults to allow Bird Kids to attempt to fly with their make-shift wings and added the hashtags #CardboardWingsAreWings, #LetBirdKidsFly and #ProtectBirdKids.&nbsp;  WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE \"This idea that we should give in to a child's imagination and affirm their delusions and then empower them to do dangerous things \u2014 my aim is to poke holes in that,\" Winn told Fox News. \"Of course, it's ridiculous to suggest that cardboard wings are real wings and that the proper thing to do is let children fly with those wings.\"&nbsp; \"And by fly, I mean jump off of roofs and get hurt,\" she added.&nbsp; The number of gender reassignment surgeries nearly tripled in the U.S. between 2016 and 2019, according to a JAMA Network Open study published in August. Nearly 8% of the 48,000 patients studied were between the ages of 12-18. More than 3,500 patients ages 12-18 underwent surgery, and around 3,200 had breast or chest procedures. \"Transgender children exist and are valid in their identities. They are not in a phase, it's who they are,\" Cam Van Fossen, the executive director of trans-inclusion advocacy organization Gender Spectrum, told Fox News. \"The narrative that transgender children are delusional or going through a phase can have negative and even deadly impacts on the long-term mental health outcomes of transgender children and youth and put their&nbsp;families at greater&nbsp;risk of violence and discrimination.\"&nbsp; \"Gender-affirming caregiving practices and medical care are both associated with decreased rates of long-term adverse mental health outcomes among trans and nonbinary youths,\" Van Fossen added.&nbsp; Winn said her memes attempt to draw a comparison between adults enabling or allowing children to make dangerous, life-altering decisions. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HAVE 'ABANDONED' DUTY OF CARE IN TREATMENT OF TRANS YOUTH, THERAPIST SAYS \"The idea is that children have big imaginations, and that's never been a problem whenever we adults have been on the same page about our role in allowing for imaginative exploratory play,\" Winn said. \"The problem isn't that children are using their big imaginations, not that adolescents are grappling with identity issues and trying on different roles and fads, the issue is with how adults are thinking about it.\"  While youth access to medical interventions for gender transition, such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery, have been widely debated in recent years, advocates argue that such care is life-saving since untreated trans youth face&nbsp;higher rates of depression and suicide. AAP HAS LONG BACKED GENDER TREATMENTS FOR MINORS Winn addressed Van Fossen's and others trans-activists' arguments that discrimination causes mental health issues among the trans population in another meme showing a graveyard with text reading: \"Bird kids murdered by bigotry. They didn\u2019t die because they flew. They died because you tried to stop them.\"&nbsp; \"I had to make a meme showing where all of this leads and how the trans rights activists flip the narrative around the tragedy of people losing their lives over this issue,\" Winn told Fox News.&nbsp; She acknowledged that trans individuals are at higher risk of suicide but disagreed that the risk largely stems from discrimination.&nbsp; \"Trans rights activists will say it's all because you didn't affirm them, it's all because they were so oppressed and unsupported,\" Winn said. \"But we have no evidence for that claim.\" \"To me, that just makes it very clear that all of us who are trying to say, \u2018Don't jump off the roof! Cardboard wings are not real wings,\u2019 that's not coming from a place of hate, it's coming from a place of care,\" she added. \"And anyone who's saying, \u2018Go ahead, jump off the roof,\u2019 you have to question their motives.\" DETRANSITIONER ISSUES 'DESPERATE PLEA' TO LAWMAKERS AT EMOTIONAL GENDER HEARING: 'MY CHILDHOOD WAS RUINED'  The&nbsp;National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) rejected the idea that affirmation can bring more harm upon transgender children. &nbsp; \"Transgender youth know who they are,\" a spokesperson told Fox News. \"Some people can trace their awareness back to their earlier memories \u2014 they just knew. Others may need more time to realize that they are transgender. We know from the 2015&nbsp;U.S. Trans Survey that many (32%) of transgender adults began to feel different from their assigned gender at birth as early as 5 years old or younger.\" \"As transgender people, our joyous and fulfilling lives are often overlooked,\" the spokesperson added. \"Just like everyone else, trans people deserve to live joyfully and authentically \u2013 and so many of us are doing just that.\" CALIFORNIA PASSES BILL PUNISHING PARENTS WHO DON'T \u2018AFFIRM\u2019 TRANS KIDS IN CUSTODY BATTLES: \u2018UTTER MADNESS!' In another meme, Winn referenced an ongoing battle over parental rights in which trans-advocates argue children need to be protected from parents who are not accepting of their gender identity.&nbsp; Earlier this month,&nbsp;California legislators voted in favor of a bill that requires judges to factor in whether a parent \"affirms\" a child's \"gender identity or gender expression\" when determining custody. In August, a federal court in Maryland ruled against parents who were suing their school district over its policy against&nbsp;telling parents if their children identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming.  Winn wrote in one meme \"It is a privilege, not a right to know if your child wears cardboard wings at school\" over an image of two children standing on a roof with cardboard wings on.&nbsp; CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The family therapist said it's \"unfortunate\" that the debate over parental rights has been politicized.&nbsp; \"I don't think that the idea of a parent's right to protect their child should be a politically polarizing issue,\" Winn said.  However, Gender Spectrum\u2019s Van Fossen said the issue is one worthy of debate. \"Research has shown that gender-supportive parenting can significantly affect our children\u2019s positive outlook on their lives, their mental health and their self-esteem,\" Van Fossen told Fox News. \"On the other hand, gender-rejecting parenting practices are directly correlated to transgender youth being more depressed and suicidal.\"", "source": "Fox News", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T09:00:27-04:00"}, {"urlToImage": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/09/931/523/Ronald-Acuna-Jr-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "title": "Braves\u2019 Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. accomplishes feat no player has ever come close to in MLB history", "content": "Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. has reached a point no man in MLB history has come close to after belting his 40th home run of the season on Friday night.&nbsp; Acu\u00f1a not only became a member of the elite 40/40 club \u2013 40 homers and 40 stolen bases in a single season \u2013 but he is the only player in MLB history to have 40 homers and 60 stolen bases in a single year.&nbsp; No other player has ever had a 40/50 season, let alone 40/60.&nbsp; CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Acu\u00f1a was already on an NL MVP pace with his .335/.414/.592 slash line as well as his 207 hits and 140 runs, which leads MLB.

Time senior correspondent Charlotte Alter described visiting and interviewing the entrepreneur in his California home.&nbsp; \"The goal is to get his 46-year-old organs to look and act like 18-year-old organs,\" she reported. According to Johnson, he now has the bones of a 30-year-old, and the heart of a 37-year-old. The journalist went on to describe Johnson\u2019s restrictive health regimen to reduce his \"biological age.\" \"That system includes downing 111 pills every day, wearing a baseball cap that shoots red light into his scalp, collecting his own stool samples, and sleeping with a tiny jet pack attached to his penis to monitor his nighttime erections,\" she wrote.  \u2018FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH\u2019 TO PREVENT SOME EFFECTS OF AGING MAY HAVE SURPRISING SOURCE: STUDY Alter then described the spartan conditions of his bedroom: \"The only two objects in the room besides his bed are a laser face-shield he uses for collagen growth and wrinkle reduction, and the device he wears on his penis while he sleeps to measure his nighttime erections.\" \"I have, on average, two hours and 12 minutes each night of erection of a certain quality,\" Johnson told the reporter. \"To be age 18, it would be three hours and 30 minutes.\" The journalist described numerous details of Johnson\u2019s routine before 6 a.m., such as measuring his \"weight, body-mass index, hydration level, body fat, and something called \u2018pulse wave velocity,\u2019\" using a \"light-therapy lamp (which mimics sun exposure) for two to three minutes to reset his circadian rhythm\" and taking his \"inner-ear temperature to monitor changes in his body.\" While scientists and medical experts Alter quoted voiced skepticism about his project and methods, Johnson suggested he is more interested in the future\u2019s opinions rather than his modern contemporaries. \"I have a relationship with the 25th century more than I have a relationship with the 21st century,\" he told Alter. \"I don't really care what people in our time and place think of me. I really care about what the 25th century thinks.\" The reporter recounted that such procedures have made his dating life difficult, noting he had listed \"what he calls the \u201810 reasons why [women] will literally hate me.\u2019 The reasons include: eating dinner at 11:30 a.m., no sunny vacations, bed at 8:30pm, no small talk, always sleeping alone, and, of course, \u2018they\u2019re not my number one priority.\u2019\"  SUPERMODEL LAUREN HUTTON SLAMS \u2018ANTI-AGING\u2019 TERM, SOCIETY'S \u2018OBSESSION WITH YOUTH\u2019 Alter questioned whether one can truly retain their humanity when their lives are so regimented around an extreme health routine.

Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said the allegations that Menendez accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for favors were \"deeply disturbing\" and that Menendez should immediately step down. Were Menendez to resign, Murphy would appoint an interim senator to serve until Menendez's current term ends in 2025.&nbsp; \"These are serious charges that implicate national security and the integrity of our criminal justice system. Murphy said Friday. The governor emphasized that Menendez is innocent until proven guilty, but said \"the alleged facts are so serious that they compromise the ability of Senator Menendez to effectively represent the people of our state. Therefore, I am calling for his immediate resignation.\" The governor's request was echoed by New Jersey Democratic Party chair LeRoy Jones, who said Menendez should resign so his legal problems don't distract voters in the upcoming state legislative elections in November.&nbsp; NEW JERSEY GOV. PHIL MURPHY CALLS ON SEN. MENENDEZ TO RESIGN FOILLOWING INDICTMENT  \"The allegations contained in the indictment that was unsealed today, if they are proven to be true, are incredibly serious and raise disturbing questions,\" Jones wrote in a statement late Friday.&nbsp; \"In the interest of ensuring that New Jerseyans continue to be granted the federal representation that they deserve, and to make sure that our party is able to keep its focus on the critical upcoming state legislative session in November, I believe that the best course of action is for Senator Menendez to resign so that he can focus his full attention on his legal defense,\" he continued. New Jersey federal Reps. Andy Kim, Miki Sherrill, Bill Pascrell, and Frank Pallone have each issued statements calling on Menendez to resign as well.&nbsp; Kim, who represents New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District in the central part of the state, was the first New Jersey Democrat to do so.&nbsp; DEMOCRATIC SEN. BOB MENENDEZ STEPS DOWN 'TEMPORARILY' AS CHAIRMAN OF SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE  \"These allegations are serious and alarming.

Rep. Den Phillips, D-Minn., said Democrats who want to restore faith in government must \"walk that talk\" in an interview on CNN.&nbsp; \"Yes, I am a Democrat and so is Sen. Menendez, but based on what I have seen, I am disappointed and yes, I think he should resign,\" Phillips said.&nbsp; DEMOCRATIC SEN. BOB MENENDEZ FACING INDICTMENT ON BRIBERY CHARGES  Rep. Jeff Jackson, D-N.C., said the same standard that applied when Democrats called for disgraced Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., to resign for \"highly unethical behavior\" must also apply to Menendez. Santos was indicted on money laundering and fraud charges but has resisted bipartisan calls to resign and will run for re-election in 2024.&nbsp; \"I called on Rep.

Back then, Darryl Strawberry was a star among many stars on the 1998 Yankees team, one of the greatest teams in baseball history, which would go on to sweep the World Series against the San Diego Padres. Yet when the Yanks raced onto the field at Qualcomm Stadium to celebrate, Strawberry wasn't there. He was back in New York, recovering from surgery to remove a tumor from his colon.  \"All through September,\" Strawberry recalls, \"I didn't feel a lot of pain, but I just kept losing weight. I had blood in my stool every time I went to the bathroom, and I knew something was wrong.\" COLON CANCER CASES SURGE AMONG YOUNGER AMERICANS, HITS HOME FOR ONE FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT Strawberry waited until the end of the regular season because he was playing well, and he did not want the team's trainers to recommend sitting him down. \"It was a great team,\" Strawberry says. \"We were just having a phenomenal season. But I knew I had to go in and get checked, and I didn't think it would be anything that serious. Once I got in, the doctors told me to sit down because they needed to talk to me. It was very serious.&nbsp;  \"They said I had colon cancer, and they could remove the tumor, and that the surgery could take as long as six hours. I was devastated because my mom passed at age 55 from terminal breast cancer. And I would end up losing my sister, Regina, at the age of 51 from cancer, too.&nbsp; \"I understood that I was in a high-risk category, that something like this could happen to any one of us in our family. It was just a really tough time for me. It was hard because I was playing baseball. I thought, I'm an athlete. I'm in great shape. How could this be?\" Strawberry's phenomenal physique may well have saved his life. The doctors told him that his abdominal muscles were so strong that they had kept the tumor locked in one place. If he hadn't had such strong abs, one big swing of the bat or one hard slide could have caused the tumor to burst and spread throughout his entire body. BE WELL: REDUCE YOUR COLON CANCER RISK WITH REGULAR SCREENINGS  When Strawberry awoke from the anesthesia after surgery, he was astonished to find a guest sitting next to him in his hospital room: George Steinbrenner. Baseball fans remember the Boss, as he was known, as the headline-grabbing, manager-firing tough guy who ran the Yankees with the firmness of a drill sergeant in the Marines. There was another side to Steinbrenner, a softer side, and this was what Strawberry saw when he awoke. \"The Boss was sitting there!\" Strawberry exclaims with a sense of wonder in his voice, 25 years after the fact. \"He was sitting right there in my hospital room! It was amazing. When I saw him, I wondered, what is he doing here? I was shocked he wanted to be there. He was concerned about what was happening with me. At that moment, the team was on the road playing for the World Series in San Diego. But the Boss wanted to be by my side instead of celebrating that victory. What a blessing. What a great man.  \"The boss had compassion for people,\" Strawberry adds. \"He had a clear understanding about people and their lives and what they go through. There was never any judgment from him about life, about my life or my struggles. I was just a part of his family, and I'm thankful that he thought of me that way.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Strawberry says that Steve Cohen, the Mets owner, has the same determination as Steinbrenner. \"Steve Cohen is the same way,\" Strawberry says. \"He'll get there. It's going to take some time. He's smart enough to know from where he's been in life and how he got to where he is, what it takes to succeed. He got there by being patient and understanding that it's going to take work. But he'll get there.\"  Although the initial surgery was successful, Strawberry's doctors warned him that the cancer could recur, and two years later it did. His left kidney had to be removed in surgery so the doctors could get at the tumor. Strawberry has been cancer-free ever since. He says that if fans really want to honor his accomplishments on the field, they should go in for a colonoscopy screening as soon as possible.

But a race against the clock doesn\u2019t measure knowledge or intelligence. It assesses the much narrower skill of how well students reason under stress. As a result, timed tests underestimate the capabilities of countless students,\" Dr. Adam Grant wrote in a New York Times opinion piece. In 2022, the College Board, which develops and administers the college readiness exams, announced it would shorten the test from three hours to two and allow exam-takers to use a calculator on all the math sections, beginning next year. Grant, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, argued this is a good thing because time pressure rewards students for rushing instead of working at a more deliberate, careful pace. He argued this skill isn't useful in the real world, where some professions require methodical attention to detail. \"You wouldn\u2019t want a surgeon who rushes through a craniectomy, or an accountant who dashes through your taxes,\" he wrote.&nbsp; ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDENT WITH 1590 SAT SCORE REJECTED BY 6 ELITE COLLEGES, BLAMES AFFIRMATIVE ACTION  There's no evidence that being able to do algebra quickly will help prepare students for the real world, even in jobs that depend on speed, he argued.&nbsp; \"Although it pays to be quick, it also pays to be determined, disciplined and dependable. Strangely, though, the tests that define students\u2019 grades and help determine their educational and professional fates are rarely designed for deliberation. They evaluate students as if they\u2019re applying to join a bomb squad or appear on \u2018Jeopardy,'\" Grant&nbsp;wrote. \"Time pressure rewards students who think fast and shallow \u2014 and punishes those who think slow and deep.\" The professor pointed to studies that purport to show more time can shrink the gender gap seen in some math tests, and improve the performance of groups with learning and reading difficulties.&nbsp; Some parents have tried to take advantage of the extended time given to students with disabilities by faking learning difficulties to \"game the system.\" Instead, every student should be given this opportunity, he argued.&nbsp; SCHOOLS SCRAMBLE TO IMPROVE STUDENTS' MATH SKILLS AS TEST SCORES CONTINUE TO LAG POST-PANDEMIC \"This madness has to end. If a significant portion of the students run out of time, it means the test is too long or the time period is too short,\" Grant insisted. The professor said he suspects the new rules will be a \"game-changer\" in education. Students should show more confidence and less anxiety around taking tests, and have \"a more realistic preview of what it takes to excel in the future,\" he argued. \"In school, timed tests teach kids that success is a sprint. But in life, success is a marathon. Wisdom is less about the speed of thought than the complexity of thinking. The students with the greatest potential aren\u2019t always the ones who can rapidly spit out the right answers. They\u2019re often the ones who take the time to ask the right questions,\" he concluded.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As the College Board conducted research on whether giving students more time would change test completion rates, they came up with staggering results. \"On average, 97 percent of students complete all questions in a section with up to seven minutes to spare on each section,\" Chief Executive Officer David Coleman said of the new tests to the Times. \"It\u2019s time we stop confusing quick with smart,\" he said. Many colleges dropped college entrance exam requirements during the coronavirus pandemic but some have moved to eliminate these exams altogether, claiming they are biased against students of color. Columbia University became the first Ivy League school to permanently drop its SAT and ACT standardized test requirements for undergraduate admissions. The Columbia College and the School of Engineering and Applied Science announced last March that going forward applicants have the option, but are not required, to send in ACT and SAT scores. The Associated Press reported that standardized test scores for high school seniors taking the ACT in 2022 were the lowest they've been since 1991. \"The class of 2022's average ACT composite score was 19.8 out of 36, marking the first time since 1991 that the average score was below 20. What's more, an increasing number of high school students failed to meet any of the subject-area benchmarks set by the ACT \u2014 showing a decline in preparedness for college-level coursework,\" a report from October 2022 said.

It's a disgrace to all the American troops, intelligence professionals and service folks who have been working diligently for decades to try to contain the Iranian threat. And it's really sad to see it happen yet again.\" The GOP candidate said his opinion of Biden's foreign policy decisions remains \"very low,\" citing a \"lack of accountability\" after the Afghanistan withdrawal that took the lives of 13 U.S. service members.

Country music fans everywhere should send the former president a thank you note.&nbsp; She claims the same fans responsible for her success, you know the ones who have deep roots in God, family and country \u2014 are suddenly misogynistic, racist, homophobic, transphobic and phobophobic. OK, I made that last one up.&nbsp; But apparently the talking points arrived from her recording studio in LA, and she dutifully checked off all the wokeified buzz words to secure her seat at the politically correct pop music table when she begins her second act.&nbsp; COUNTRY SINGER QUITTING GENRE DUE TO EFFECT OF 'TRUMP YEARS' WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: MUSIC CRITIC Not that she needed to prove her woke bona fides. She already had an impressive record. Ever since she landed in Nashville she\u2019s been insufferable.&nbsp; Earlier this year Morris&nbsp;bragged about introducing her 2-year-old to drag queens at a pro-LGBTQ event, and dared the state of Tennessee to arrest her. This was weeks after the state banned drag shows near schools. Why are these people so angry they can\u2019t sexualize kids?  She\u2019s crowned herself the authority on&nbsp;all things toxic, and as far as Morris is concerned what qualifies as&nbsp;\"really toxic\" \u2014 not just the regular kind of toxic \u2014 is Jason Aldean\u2019s&nbsp;\"Try that in a Small Town.\" You know, the song that condemns violent crime in our country. According to the book of Morris, what\u2019s definitely not toxic is her flame throwing at Aldean\u2019s wife Brittany, who seems to live rent free in her head. Last year Brittany posted a video on Instagram applying makeup and thanking her parents for not changing her gender during her tomboy phase because she loves her \"girly life.\" That enraged Karen, I mean Maren, who\u2019s a proponent of child sex change surgeries&nbsp;and obsessed with allowing drag queens to shake their stuff in front of kids. What\u2019s next an LA strip club selfie with her toddler?&nbsp; Still, Morris took the classy not trashy road \u2014 just kidding. COUNTRY MUSIC STAR SHARES WHY HE\u2019S LEAVING THE INDUSTRY AND HEADING INTO MINISTRY: \u2018WHAT I\u2019M CALLED TO DO\u2019&nbsp; She went&nbsp;straight to name calling \u2014 starting with \"scumbag human.\"Followed up later by, \"You know, I\u2019m glad she didn\u2019t become a boy either because we really don\u2019t need another a**hole dude in the world\u2026\"  And putting an exclamation on it all, \"F** all the way off to Insurrection Barbie and the fellow IB\u2019s trolling this comment section with their hypocritical, hateful a**es.\"&nbsp; In other words, not just Brittany but anyone who disagrees with Morris. If you\u2019re counting, most of the country music demographic thinks cutting off kids\u2019 genitals is a really bad idea. Chaser:&nbsp;Still \"Karening\"&nbsp;Morris has said of all of country music,&nbsp;\"I hate feeling like I need to be the hall monitor of treating people like human beings in country music,\" and it \"got worse&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;irreparable, almost\" after Trump got elected.&nbsp; It must be exhausting being so morally superior. Morris was still so triggered by Brittany that she \"didn\u2019t feel comfortable going\" to the CMAs last year, except to show up halfway through the event, just in time for the presentation of the award she was nominated for, Album of the Year. She lost, and she left. Grossly overestimating her importance, Morris said of country music,&nbsp;\"I thought I\u2019d like to burn it to the ground and start over. But it\u2019s burning itself down without my help.\"&nbsp; COUNTRY MUSIC FANS IN NASHVILLE REACT TO SINGER QUITTING GENRE CLAIMING 'TRUMP YEARS' USHERED IN TOXICITY Not exactly. In August history was made when country music took the top three spots for the first time ever on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. No fires to put out there.&nbsp; Playing the role of the angry, narcissistic victim, she may have failed at burning country music to the ground, but she\u2019s certainly burned the bridge to an industry run by woke brass who were more than happy to hand her multiple CMA and ACM awards and throw their support behind an extreme leftist female artist.  As far as country fans are concerned, pop music can come get their person. We\u2019re done with her. It would appear as though the rise of Jason Aldean and Oliver Anthony\u2019s music may have sent her over the edge. Aldean\u2019s song, \"Try that in a Small Town\" went straight to number one on the iTunes chart right before it&nbsp;scored him his first number one spot on Billboard Hot 100. Almost overnight Anthony went from playing his guitar on his Virginia farm to&nbsp;becoming a household name. \"Rich Men North of Richmond,\" a song about the discrepancy between the working class and the elites that run the show in Washington, shot to number one on Billboard Hot 100, making him the first artist with no prior chart history to ever debut at number one. In addition to Billboard, he claimed the number one spot on the ITunes chart for his debut song and then landed in the number two and three spots with two more songs. Relatable is the only explanation for the massive skyrocketing success of Anthony, as well as Aldean\u2019s \"Try That in a Small Town\". People relate to what\u2019s real. You can\u2019t fake authentic.&nbsp; CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION While Maren Morris is busy \"hall monitoring\" the unenlightened among us for saying it\u2019s a really bad idea to cut off kids\u2019 private parts, artists like Aldean and Anthony are writing songs that connect with average Americans.&nbsp;  And when given the choice Morris would rather sell out her audience than connect with them. She\u2019ll pick opportunistic over authentic ever single time. Her new EP, \"The Bridge,\" is supposed to&nbsp;symbolically connect her past in country music to her future. I think we\u2019ve established that she\u2019s already burned the country music bridge. Ironically, it was released last week just as her temper tantrum declaring her country music exit was kicking into high gear. Shocking, I know. She calls the two songs on the EP \"incredibly key to my next step.\" In the video for&nbsp;\"The Tree,\" she\u2019s shown lighting a match and watching a tree burn. Somebody please check on her. She\u2019s obsessed with burning stuff down. The tree is supposed to symbolize country music, which has been so \"draining\" and unhealthy for her \u2014 or something. We\u2019re just supposed to know that she\u2019s the victim.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The second song is self-explanatory \u2014 \"Get the Hell Out of Here.\"&nbsp; I\u2019m fairly confident I speak for most country music fans when I say we couldn\u2019t agree more.

But honest inquiry applies the same standard to all people rather than single out those with whom one disagrees,\" Gretchen Reiter, senior vice president of communications at Stand Together, told Fox News Digital.  OVER 100 FORMER CLERKS OF JUSTICE THOMAS SIGN OPEN LETTER DEFENDING HIS INTEGRITY, INDEPENDENCE \"There is a long tradition of public officials, including Supreme Court Justices, sharing their experiences, ideas and judicial philosophy with members of the public at dinners and other event,\" said Reiter.&nbsp; \"All of the sitting Justices and many who came before them have contributed to the national dialogue in speeches book tours, and social gatherings. Our events are no different. To claim otherwise is false.\"&nbsp; The event in which Justice Thomas attended occurred in January 2018 in Palm Springs, California. ProPublica notes that a Stand Together spokesperson said, \"Thomas wasn\u2019t present for fundraising conversations.\"\"Stand Together\u2019s January 2018 summit was attended by several hundred people, including members of the media who covered the event,\" Reiter said.&nbsp; \"In fact, Stand Together has hosted dozens of summits over decades.

Justice Thomas has been a dear friend, and I would never pass up an opportunity to help him share, in his own words, his lifetime of accomplishment and judicial philosophy with new audiences,\" Leo said.&nbsp; \"All the necessary due diligence was performed to ensure the Justice\u2019s attendance at the events was compliant with all ethics requirements,\" he added.&nbsp; Mark Paoletta, a close friend of Justice Thomas and a lawyer based in Washington, D.C., said that Thomas \"acted ethically and appropriately,\" contrary to ProPublica's \"misleading portrait.\" \"Contrary to the false and misleading portrait by the leftwing, billionaire-funded group ProPublica, Justice Thomas acted ethically and appropriately, and consistent with how many Justices have conducted themselves, as even ProPublica admits,\" Paoletta said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\"Justice Thomas has given speeches at various events and gatherings across the country. Every Justice does that. This is a good thing, as the Justices should not be cloistered,\" he said.&nbsp;Paoletta noted that the \"Judicial Canons,\" which are part of the code of conduct for federal judges, state that \"a judge should not become isolated from the society in which the judge lives,\" and encourages justices to speak at organizations dedicated to the law \"and also engage in a wide range of non-law-related activities.\"In addition, Paoletta notes that justices are not required to disclose every speech or gathering they attend. &nbsp; \"Recently, Justice Thomas met at the Court with 60 students from a school in the Bronx. I can\u2019t wait for ProPublica\u2019s expose about Justice Thomas not disclosing this meeting on his form next year,\" he said. Carrie Severino, president of JCN and former clerk for Justice Thomas, called the article a \"hit piece.\"&nbsp; \"Another day and another hit piece on Justice Thomas from Pro Publica, which is nothing more than a front group for left-wing billionaires and their political agendas,\" she said. ProPublica notes that Thomas could be a key voice in an upcoming Supreme Court case, Loper Bright Enterprises v.

THOMAS BLASTS JACKSON'S 'RACE-INFUSED WORLD VIEW' IN SUPREME COURT RULING OUTLAWING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Stand Together has financially supported the Cause of Action Institute, the legal organization representing the plaintiffs in the case. The plaintiffs, a group of New Jersey fishermen, sued the government in 2020, saying that a federal agency requiring them to pay $700 per day for a contractor who monitors their boats to ensure regulatory compliance, is out-of-bounds for a federal agency, and that such a burdensome requirement should be imposed by Congress only. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The fisherman appealed their case to the Supreme Court in 2022.

Robert Menendez, D-N.J., of bribery is devastating. The senator enjoys the presumption of innocence, and an indictment only reflects the government\u2019s side of the case, but the indictment contains a level of detail and a description of official acts taken by the senator that will be difficult for the defense to overcome and likely impossible for the senator to overcome politically.&nbsp; Sen. Menendez may have nine lives, but perhaps he used up eight of them successfully defending the last corruption case against him, in 2017.&nbsp; This indictment paints a picture of old-school, politician-on-the-take corruption. There is little nuance to envelopes of cash \u2013 nearly $500,000 worth \u2013 a new Mercedes-Benz convertible, a no-show job, and in a throwback to another era, $150,000 worth of real gold bars found at his house during an FBI search in June 2022. It is surprising that they did not also find a Tommy Gun, just to complete the picture.&nbsp; MENENDEZ DEFIANT AS GROWING CHORUS OF DEMOCRATS CALL FOR HIS RESIGNATION More important than the image of these valuables is how Sen. Menendez and his wife, Nadine (also charged in the indictment), came to possess them.&nbsp;  Nadine Menendez started dating the senator in February 2018. Among the things she brought into the relationship was her longtime friendship with Will Hana, a New Jersey businessman of Egyptian descent, who maintained close ties with Egyptian officials. Hana, along with his associates, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes, are all codefendants with Senator and Mrs. Menendez.&nbsp; They immediately put the senator to work.&nbsp; The indictment describes numerous official actions taken by Sen. Menendez beginning in March 2018, and valuable items bestowed upon him and Nadine close enough in time to create a strong inference of a quid pro quo.&nbsp; Texts between Nadine Menendez and Hana, Uribe and Daibes, tie the bribery allegations together tightly, as do details such as fingerprints and/or DNA of Daibes or his driver appearing on the envelopes of cash found in the Menendezes\u2019 house; a Google search performed by Sen. Menendez for \"kilo of gold price\"; and Hana purchasing 22 gold bars two days after the senator met with him and an Egyptian official -- and two of those gold bars subsequently being found in the Menendezes\u2019 home. DEMOCRATIC SEN. BOB MENENDEZ FACING INDICTMENT ON BRIBERY CHARGES Bribery cases have become more difficult for the government to bring in recent years. In the case against former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, the Supreme Court narrowed the definition of what constitutes an \"official act\" to support a bribery conviction against a government official.&nbsp; Specifically, the Court observed that \"setting up a meeting, calling another public official, or hosting an event does not, standing alone, qualify as an 'official act.'\"&nbsp;  Further, for purposes of establishing bribery in an honest services fraud prosecution, the Court concluded, an \"official act\" requires a public official to \"make a decision or take an action,\" or agree to do so, on a \"question, matter, cause, suit, proceeding or controversy.\" DEMOCRATIC SEN. BOB MENENDEZ STEPS DOWN 'TEMPORARILY' AS CHAIRMAN OF SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE The actions Sen. Menendez is alleged to have taken for the benefit of Hana, Uribe and Daibes, if proven, clearly surpass the bar set for bribery in the McDonnell case.&nbsp; Indeed, they represent classic, even extreme, illustrations of how a senator might sell out his office if he were so inclined, for example:  These official actions that the New Jersey Democrat took in exchange for this treasure go to the heart of his responsibilities as a senator and would reflect an astounding betrayal of his oath of office.&nbsp; NEW JERSEY GOV. PHIL MURPHY CALLS ON SEN. MENENDEZ TO RESIGN FOLLOWING INDICTMENT Interference with ongoing criminal investigations is \"third-rail\" stuff for elected officials, and manipulating foreign military aid can have profound policy implications.&nbsp;  It does not appear that the senator will be able to credibly characterize these official actions as benign \"constituent services.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Sen. Menendez has faced corruption charges before.&nbsp;In 2015, he was alleged to have accepted close to $1 million worth of lavish gifts and campaign contributions from Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist. Melgen was involved in a billing dispute with Medicare, and Senator Menendez allegedly used his staff to try to advocate on Melgen\u2019s behalf, among other favors for Melgen. That case resulted in a hung jury after Sen. Menendez emphasized in his defense that he had a longtime genuine friendship with Melgen, and then decoupled Melgen\u2019s largesse from his official actions \u2013 \"just friends helping friends,\" went the defense theme.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The present case involves several significant differences from the Melgen matter: Sen. Menendez does not have a longtime friendship with Hana, et al.; the official actions he took on their behalf were far more consequential; and the items of value he received from them were far more scandalous than the vacations he took with his pal Dr. Melgen. Bottom line: It will be difficult for him to prevail with the same playbook this time around. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SCOTT A.

THESE 6 EXPERT TIPS MAY GET YOU THERE \"Night owls with delayed melatonin secretion patterns may experience difficulties in glucose tolerance \u2014 thereby raising their diabetes risk.\"  Quality of sleep is a \"major concern\" for night owls, Whittington emphasized, especially when many people are expected to wake up early for work and other ongoing commitments. \"Poor sleep quality has been directly associated with&nbsp;insulin resistance, a well-established precursor to diabetes,\" he said.&nbsp; \"Not to mention, chronotype is partly genetically determined, raising the possibility that some individuals may be genetically&nbsp;predisposed to both evening preferences and diabetes.\"  \"Emerging research also suggests that the gut microbiome, which plays a significant role in metabolism, has its own circadian rhythm that could be affected by disruptions in the sleep-wake cycle,\" the doctor added. Although these findings may seem concerning for night owls, Whittington listed some measures people can take to reduce type 2 diabetes risk, including syncing up your schedule, focusing on sleep hygiene, exercising, managing stress and paying attention to diet.

Superstar Aaron Judge is coming off a historic 2022 campaign, but the slugger has dealt with injury setbacks this year limiting him to 100 games so far. Judge gave the Yankees a reason to celebrate on Friday when he smashed three home runs during a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.&nbsp; The homers marked the second time this season that Judge has managed to hit three balls over the outfield wall this season \u2014 which set a Yankees record. \"It\u2019s incredible,\" Judge said after New York\u2019s 7-1 victory. \"You see the list of players that have come through here, the retired numbers out there, but I just tried to do my job.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  Judge hit a three-run homer in the third and a two-run shot in the fifth off rookie starter Brandon Pfaadt.

Not surprising that he\u2019s on that list.\" STEPHEN A SMITH BOTCHES 1ST PITCH AT YANKEE STADIUM: 'I CHOKED' After rounding the bases, Judge took a curtain call from the Yankee Stadium crowd as teammate Gleyber Torres stepped out of the batter\u2019s box. \"It was great,\" Judge said. \"Anytime Yankee fans want to show some love and appreciation, I love it. It was a pretty cool moment right there.\" Only five other Yankees players have delivered multiple three-homer games.  Lou Gehrig, who also hit four homers in June 1926 at Philadelphia against the A's, leads the Yankees with four such games. Joe DiMaggio and Alex Rodr\u00edguez had three, and Tony Lazzeri and Bobby Murcer two apiece. Judge's first career three-homer game happened last month. During an August 23 game against the Washington Nationals, Judge crushed three home runs to help lift New York to a 9-1 victory. The win also ended the Yankees' nine game losing streak.  Judge is hitting .267 with 35 homers and 70 RBIs in 100 games this season. He missed nearly eight weeks after spraining his right big toe on June 3 at Dodger Stadium.

Tuscaloosa County is a member of the state's 7A classification. \"We got a call from the (Alabama High School Athletic Association) that we had some athletes recognized by receiving some cards to eat at Buffalo Wild Wings,\" Tuscaloosa County head coach Adam Winegarden said earlier this month via NJ.com. \"Since they received those gift cards, it broke their status as amateur athletes.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM  The AHSAA held a meeting on Tuesday and clarified its amateur rule as it pertains to gift cards to food establishments.

Winegarden said he would have preferred to have heard from the school that reported the possible violation before they went to the association. \"We are really disappointed we didn\u2019t get a call from the school which turned us in,\" Winegarden said.

It works by plugging one adapter into an outlet near your router and another one into an outlet near your TV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, you can connect your devices using ethernet cables or WiFi. This way, you can enjoy a fast and stable network connection without having to drill holes or run long wires.&nbsp; Another version of the powerline adapter is one that transmits the signal via WiFi. Unlike a wired powerline adapter, a wireless one does not need an ethernet cable to connect to your TV. However, you still need to plug it into an outlet near your TV and pair it with another unit near your network monitor.&nbsp; See my top picks for best power line adapters&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a WiFi extender?&nbsp; Helen could also consider using a WiFi extender to improve her WiFi signal at home. A WiFi extender is a device that amplifies and retransmits the internet signal from the router to areas where it is weak or nonexistent. A WiFi extender should be placed halfway between the router and the dead zone for optimal performance.&nbsp; There are two types of WiFi extenders: a plug-in extender that fits into a wall socket, and a desktop extender that has ethernet ports. Some WiFi extenders use the same wireless network as the router, while others create a separate network that requires switching devices. A WiFi extender should support the same or higher WiFi standard as the router. See my top picks for best WiFi extenders&nbsp; The main difference between the powerline adapter and a WiFi extender&nbsp;  PLUG IN YOUR ADDRESS TO SEE IF YOU\u2019RE OVERPAYING FOR INTERNET The main difference between the powerline adapter and a WiFi extender is that a powerline adapter uses a wired connection, while a WiFi extender uses a wireless connection and does not need any electrical wiring or an Ethernet cable. Both devices can help you improve your internet access in different areas of your home, but they have different advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp; Powerline adapter vs. WiFi extender: pros and cons &nbsp; Powerline Adapter Pros&nbsp; A powerline adapter can provide a more stable and faster connection than a WiFi extender.&nbsp; Cons&nbsp; It depends on the quality of your electrical wiring and the distance between the plugs. A powerline adapter might not work well if your home has old or faulty wiring or if there are too many devices plugged into the same circuit.&nbsp; WiFi Extender Pros&nbsp; A WiFi extender can be easier to set up and use than a powerline adapter.&nbsp; MORE: HOW TO SPEED UP YOUR WIFI, INTERNET CONNECTIONS&nbsp; Cons &nbsp; It might not deliver the same speed or reliability as a wired connection.&nbsp; A WiFi extender might create interference with other wireless devices or networks or suffer from interference itself.&nbsp; A WiFi extender might also reduce the bandwidth of your original WiFi network, since it uses some of it to communicate with the router. &nbsp; Option to upgrade to a mesh network&nbsp; Alternatively, Helen could upgrade to a mesh network. This may set her back a little more money, but it could be the easiest and best solution to getting a good internet signal in every area of the home. This is how I was able to get a strong signal in the nooks and crannies of our 1927 brick house, both inside and outside, where we need good WiFi to support our wireless security cameras.&nbsp; This third mesh option will definitely boost her WiFi signal in her home. A mesh network is a group of connectivity devices, such as WiFi routers, that act as a single network, so there are multiple sources of connectivity around your house instead of just a single router.&nbsp; A mesh network can provide better coverage, performance and reliability than a single router or a WiFi extender. However, it can also be more expensive and complex to set up than other options. You will need to buy compatible mesh devices and place them strategically around your home to ensure optimal signal strength and avoid interference.  YOU\u2019RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE IF YOU HAVEN\u2019T CHECKED WHAT\u2019S ON YOUR WIRELESS NETWORK&nbsp; You will also need to configure the mesh network using an app or software that may vary, depending on the manufacturer. A mesh network is ideal for large homes with multiple floors and rooms or homes with thick walls or other obstacles that block WiFi signals.&nbsp; See my top mesh networking winners by clicking here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kurt's key takeaways&nbsp; What you use to boost your WiFi signal in your home will ultimately depend on how your home is set up and what will work best for it as a result.&nbsp; If your electrical wiring allows it, I would certainly say that a powerline adapter will give you better WiFi coverage with much less of a hassle than a WiFi extender might.&nbsp; A third option could be a mesh network. Keep in mind that this is the most expensive option but a preferred way to get a solid signal everywhere at home.&nbsp; Where is the toughest spot in your home to get a good WiFi signal?

Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Fox News Digital that his country, which is led by a conservative government, had strong relations with the U.S. during the Trump administration, but that it has soured with the new Biden administration. \"We had the best ever political relationship with the United States during the term of President Trump, the best ever political relationship. And I think the reason for that was that President Trump has based this bilateral relationship on mutual respect, and he did not have the intention to judge, to lecture or educate us,\" he said. \"He concentrated on America to develop \u2014 America First \u2014 and he concentrated on the relationship of ours to develop as well, which can bring mutual benefit for both sides.\" He says that now, the Biden administration has sought to interfere with domestic issues, and highlighted a move in 2022 to end a bilateral tax agreement that prevented double taxation after Hungary reduced its corporate income tax. Last month, the U.S. also restricted visa-free travel for Hungarian passport holders, citing security concerns, and has also repeatedly criticized the government for its human rights record. UNITED STATES IMPOSES TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS ON HUNGARIAN CITIZENS OVER VERIFICATION CONCERNS&nbsp;  \"The Democrat administration is making continuous attempts to interfere in domestic issues in Hungary, they are judging us, they are lecturing us. The fact that they have terminated and broken the bilateral tax agreement between the two countries is a clear signal that they tried to put political pressure or economic pressure on us to change policies,\" he said. \"And this is unacceptable.\" He said there is no longer \"mutual respect\" that was there during the Trump era, and suggested that political factors are at play.&nbsp; \"We understand that the U.S. establishment is very unhappy with the fact that a conservative, right-wing, patriotic Christian Democrat government has been in office in Hungary for such a long time, and it is not enough that we have been in office for a long time, but we have proven to be successful, and I think this is very uncomfortable for many liberal forces around the world. So we do hope that our relationship will come back to the level where it used to be under President Trump.\" As for specific disagreements, he highlighted the war in Ukraine. He estimates that there are 150,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Ukraine, some of whom have been conscripted into the army and deployed.&nbsp; \"So we Hungarians are losing our nation mates, let's put it this way, and we do not want to lose any more Hungarians in this war. We don't want to see any more casualties in this war \u2014 not only Hungarians, none of them,\" he said.  The U.S. has sought to end the conflict by backing Ukraine with funding and weapons to retake territory seized by the Russians, but Hungary sees delivering weapons as prolonging the conflict.&nbsp;President Biden told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday that the U.S. is \"staying with you\" as he pushes Congress to provide additional funding for the war effort. Szijjarto said that his country wants to see the U.S. bringing \"peace into the neighborhood, and not weapons.\" He said he believed that would be more likely under former President Donald Trump, who is running to retake the White House in 2024 and has said that he would launch peace talks to bring the conflict to an end if re-elected.&nbsp; TRUMP DESCRIBES HOW HE COULD SOLVE RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT IN 24 HOURS  \"We understand the position of President Trump, who would like to bring peace into our region. And we wish that an American administration brings peace into the region, because we have to be realistic that, without the United States, there will be no peace in the region,\" Szijjarto said. \"And as far as we listen to President Trump, this is really encouraging, and we cross fingers for him, for our own interests, because we have a track record already with him.

We have an experience about how we work together, and we have a hope for the president of the United States to make peace in our neighborhood.

Ukraine therefore has made a renewed and more desperate push to try and hit at Russia\u2019s supply lines and support structure in order to blunt offensive efforts as the winter weather sets in, at which point officials from both sides anticipate a slowdown in fighting.&nbsp; The first winter in the war saw a drop in the overall fighting and more focused efforts, particularly around the city of Bakhmut, which has changed hands between the two sides at least twice so far.

In 2021, 710 children in the U.S. under the age of 13 were killed in vehicle crashes, and more than 100,000 were injured, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Among those who died, more than a third of the kids were not properly restrained. And in a national survey by Cars.com, 60% of parents said they have struggled with car seat installation. To mark National Child Passenger Safety Week and National Seat Check Saturday, Cars.com\u2019s certified child safety seat technician, Jenni Newman, shared with Fox News Digital her \"dos and don\u2019ts\" for proper car seat installation. 3 CAR SEAT INSTALLATION MISTAKES YOU NEED TO AVOID Read on for these important tips.&nbsp; DO tighten straps as needed \"As your child grows, you\u2019ll need to adjust the harness straps\u2019 location in infant seats, convertible seats and combination seats,\" said Newman, who is based in Chicago. A child in a rear-facing seat should have the harness straps positioned at or below the shoulders, she advised. When forward-facing, the straps should be at or above the shoulders.  DON\u2019T turn the car seats around too soon It\u2019s important for parents to know when to go from rear-facing to forward-facing, Newman said. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children\u2019s car seats remain rear-facing as long as possible to better protect the head, neck and spine in the event of an accident.  \"Keep your child rear-facing until they reach the car seat\u2019s height or weight limit,\" Newman said. DON\u2019T use both: Choose the latch OR the seatbelt  Child car seats can be installed using either the vehicle\u2019s built-in seat belt or the LATCH system (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children). Since 1999, federal law has required top tether anchors in new cars and top tether straps on all front-facing child seats, according to Consumer Reports. KIDS AS YOUNG AS 4 YEARS OLD CAN BEGIN TO LEARN MEDICAL EMERGENCY TRAINING: NEW REPORT Since 2000, lower anchors have been required in almost all cars and light trucks, and all car seats made on or after Sept. 1, 2002 have the corresponding hooks. Some parents think using both the LATCH system and the seatbelt will add security \u2014 but Newman said that\u2019s not true.&nbsp;  \"Choose one option and go with it,\" she said.&nbsp; \"If you choose to install via the seatbelt, make sure to follow the extra step of locking the seat belt retractor to prevent the seat from moving around.\" DO remember the top tether anchor The top tether anchor is often forgotten because it\u2019s usually on a seat back or somewhere not as visible as the lower anchors, Newman noted.&nbsp;  \"For forward-facing car seats, it\u2019s essential to connect the tether strap to the tether anchor,\" she said.&nbsp; \"This limits a child's head and neck movement in the event of a crash.\" DO register your car seat It can be easy to overlook the small registration card that comes with every new car seat, but Newman said it\u2019s an important tool in keeping your child safe.&nbsp; MELATONIN WARNINGS: NEARLY HALF OF PARENTS GIVE IT TO THEIR KIDS TO HELP THEM SLEEP, BUT EXPERTS URGE CAUTION \"Registering your car seat allows the car-seat manufacturer to alert you in the event of a recall,\" she noted.&nbsp; If you\u2019ve misplaced the registration card \u2014 or if you\u2019re not sure whether you registered the seat \u2014 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has a tool that provides the online registration link for each car-seat maker. DO read the manual \"Before you install a car seat, make sure to read both the car seat manual and the car owner\u2019s manual for some help,\" Newman said.&nbsp; CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Be sure to read through both thoroughly and follow the instructions to the letter.\" DON\u2019T be afraid to ask for help  \"If you\u2019re unsure if you\u2019ve installed your child\u2019s car seat correctly, get help,\" Newman said.&nbsp; You\u2019ll often be able to find a certified child passenger safety tech at a local fire department, police station or car dealership, she suggested.
